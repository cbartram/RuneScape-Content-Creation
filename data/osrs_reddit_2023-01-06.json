[{"title":"My brother and I just \u201cbeat the game\u201d","content":"My brother and I have been playing on and off since 2005. RuneScape has always been alluring to us, and we have made countless accounts over the years. From Oldschool maxed combat mains, to ironman accounts hoping to show off some great achievements. The whole solo bossing concept wasn\u2019t appealing to us, though. Then, GIM was announced, and we eagerly awaited for its implementation in the game. Afraid we wouldn\u2019t get to play as much due to family, college, work, and other obligations a lot of us face within this OSRS community, we decided to start anyways, strictly as a GIM duo, and it has been the most fun I\u2019ve had playing RuneScape. \n\nSince creating our accounts over a year ago, we are slowly approaching 2k total level and just started COX. We had little experience doing COX when it first came out, so the COX experience was even more fun when we started doing raids a few days ago. \n\nYesterday, we pretty much \u201cbeat the game.\u201d Achieving around 40,000 points as a duo, our odds were around 1\/22 to receive a purple. Seven raids in, I told my brother to hide the chat box, which he had failed to do, and all I hear from the other side of the mic is, \u201cYOU JUST GOT A TBOW, YOU JUST GOT A TBOW.\u201d \n\nConfused, excited, and not sure what this even meant for our accounts (since we\u2019ve never owned a Tbow), I opened the chat, and in my dismay, my own brother had lied to me\u2026\n\nHE GOT THE TBOW! We couldn\u2019t believe our eyes as he opened the chest and wielded it in all its glory. We got one of the best items in the entire game with it being our first ever purple as duo GIM. That has been the climax of my experience thus far. I will always remember that moment because it was so incredible lol! The chances of that being the first purple is absolutely ridiculous, and I\u2019m sorry to anyone who is dry there.

On any given island there can a number of pve encounters:\n\n1. World bosses (bosses that anyone can attack with anyone else on a world, like gwd bosses).\n2. Dungeons (bosses that can only be fought in an instance either solo, or in a team).\n\nYour regular gear, weapons and armour won't work on these islands. You'll need to help the communities there in order to be rewarded with new gear that can be used on the various islands.\n\n# LOOT MECHANICS\n\nLoot from these encounters will be dropped in a similar way to Nex. Each time you complete a pve encounter, the rewards you can receive include weapons, armour and resources.\n\nLoot is rolled per player, meaning that more than 1 person can receive the same unique and there can be multiple uniques dropped per kc. There will be a damage threshold that grants better odds than the base rate for uniques if you surpass it.\n\nAll weapons and armour items will be untradable to players other than the group you were with (and only for 1 hour to them). Materials, resources, etc will be tradable to others but will be important to collect.\n\n# Account progression\n\nEach time you complete a dungeon, you will have the option to scale up the encounter like an enrage mechanic where specific stats are modified to make the encounters more difficult. So think cox, then cox 2, then cox 3 and so on.\n\nEvery 5 levels you ascend, you will be introduced to new mechanics. Every 10 levels you scale, you will be rewarded with a new unique drop table that features upgrades to your weapons and armour as well as more resources that can be crafted into weapons and armour if you didn't get them as a drop (but crafted default gear won't be as good as awarded drops of your tier), and those resources can later enhance your gear to make them even better. Clearing the encounters also awards sailing skill experience as does the crafting and enhancing of gear.\n\nThe weapons and armour you can be awarded, craft and upgrade are both hand weapon slots, gloves, amulets, head, chest, legs, boots, cape, and ring.\n\n# Tradable loot\n\nAt a raid scale of 20 (max scale) for an island, the new loot table you gain access to includes tradable rewards. These are able to buff your existing weapons and armour, granting them unique stats and effects.\n\nYou have to have an existing set of island specific weapon and armour to even buff them with these rewards and they only enhance that level. Meaning if you used the tradable rewards to buff your current gear that is only at a level 10 tier and replaced that gear with better items at level 15 or level 20, then you'd have to get more of those tradable rewards to buff the new gear set you have. Making them forever useful to yourself and other players that are interested in higher level pve encounters.\n\n# Summary\n\nYou explore dungeons and take on world bosses to continually upgrade untradable zone specific gear with tradable resources. The world bosses have immense health and deal a relatively good amount of dps, requiring you to fight in a team. After completing a dungeon, you are awarded weapons, armour, resources and given the option to scale up the dungeon for better and more effective loot. The higher you go, the better the untradable weapon and armour rewards. There's tradable rewards as well that enhance your gear.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10533fc\/how_the_new_skill_could_create_an_entirely_new\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10533fc\/how_the_new_skill_could_create_an_entirely_new\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 02:30 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"100 Laps with Penguin facts daily until agility pet - Day 93","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10536l1\/100_laps_with_penguin_facts_daily_until_agility\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/c0izz6q0oiaa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 02:34 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"osrs!! group and HCIM GROUP ROOM","content":"Discord: Shmerk\n\nLooking for friends and shit to watch videos and just chat with on the side too! network and share stuff, but to the point!\n\nI started a hardcore ironman group with another person, and i made 3 extra accounts, im looking to give these accounts out to other people that want to join the team, they will get to change email and password and stuff, we just ask that you give us the information back if you are going to quit, once we get all comfortable with each other we will be able to share the information freely, but for now the HARDCORE STATUS IS ALL THAT MATTERS!!!

But this begs the question, what if we had a similar skill, but with its own identity and balancing? Now fair warning, I'm going to be spitballing a lot of ideas here with the intention of using feedback I receive to refine this idea much like a lot of other suggestions I've seen on here. So here we go:\n\nEnter the Taming skill, a skill where you traverse Gielinor to earn the loyalty of the  world's various creatures. As the skill progresses, you're able to tame  more and more powerful creatures to aid you in skilling and combat.  This could be a great way to reintroduce a lot of the summoning pet animals  like squirrels, the different breeds of dogs, monkeys and maybe even the God Birds like the Zamorak Hawk as well? \n\nSo, how would such a skill's gameplay loop work? When beginning to train Taming, you would receive a dog to start the skill with. Dogs would have some combat use, albeit a weak one, but to start with it'll suffice to help you get the first few levels. After your first few levels gained from Fido chomping the green behinds of many a goblin, you're able to start taming new animals. First you would need to create or buy treats using cooking and specialized traps made with crafting to hold the creature in place and tame it. You would then need to choose the correct interaction in order to gain the creature's trust. In order to 'summon'  it, you'd create a magic whistle that you bind to the creature you've just gained the trust of to call your new companion forward. Combat companions would need to be healed via food if damaged in combat, and if they die, another needs to be captured. (Though you could have the excuse to add a new Arceuus Spell to resurrect fallen followers) Followers also cannot remain out indefinitely however, as they need rest just like we do!  An animal's energy would renew overtime when not in use as to provide one avenue of balancing. Another balance to discuss of course, and maybe the elephant in the room for some when Summoning was mentioned is the BoBs, which get stupid OP in RS3 at high summoning levels. Perhaps here, certain animal companions would be able to be equipped with degradable satchels made with crafting that offer a few extra slots, but with nowhere near as much as something like the yaks or mammoths of RS3.\n\nSo here's an additional idea. Companions could have randomized stats, with a very small chance for one stat being perfect, and extremely low chance of all of them being so. What's a way to afk this is so you're not tearing your hair out taming every single unicorn in the world to get the one horse to rule them all? Breeding. Perhaps ranches throughout the world could serve as places to shelter your beloved companions in order to get the chance for the perfect creature. So, you've just received your bulldog with perfect stats and...it's outclassed by the Bear you've just tamed near Varrock. What do you do with your pooch now? Enter collars, an item you can only use on a companion with perfect stats to irreversibly transform them into Pets. Again, part of the idea here is the introduction of pets that were beloved back in the pre-OSRS days, but in this way, they're more of an achievement than simply hatching an egg or buying one.\n\nOverall, the idea is to create a skill based somewhat on Summoning, with it's own skill interactions and with it's own identity and balancing. Not to mention that such a skill could well and truly interact with every other skill, but in the creation of items and the bonuses provided from your companions.

The chance of a mark spawning also goes down by a factor of 5 if you're 20+ Agility levels above the course requirement.\n\nHere's the weird part: probably due to a bug, not only is the base mark-of-grace rate **twice as high** for Canifis as it is for the similar level courses (Falador, Varrock, etc), but also **the 5x nerf if you're too high level doesn't apply at all to Canifis**. So in practice, doing Canifis at level 99 (or any level really) will give a 67% chance at a mark, even though it should probably be more like 6.7%. 10 times lower.\n\nOverall this doesn't result in anything quite as crazy as twice as many marks per hour from Canifis versus the others (the 3 minute cooldown helps even it out a bit), but it does mean that Canifis is always at least 50% better than Falador for marks, and remains the best course in the entire game (~18.2 per hour) until you've done the elite Ardougne diary (~22.0 per hour).\n\n[Here's a graph](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/517605269849636864\/1060417159265800224\/chrome_J5Ie2xDWqb.png) of the marks per hour you can expect if you do each course without failure, in the appropriate level band - remember that all of them (except Canifis) additionally get nerfed hard if you go 20 levels above the requirement.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550wn\/fun_fact_canifis_is_always_the_best_rooftop\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550wn\/fun_fact_canifis_is_always_the_best_rooftop\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:46 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"My account was banned for no reason","content":"[removed]","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550yp\/my_account_was_banned_for_no_reason\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550yp\/my_account_was_banned_for_no_reason\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:46 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Anyone part of the Black Arm gang that I can trade to complete Shield of Arrav?

For example, we lose the ability to protect 100% against a combat style (maybe only 50% instead), but gain some other combat buffs which are more substantial than the standard book.\n\nOn to my idea. I always thought that having a magic-based melee attack or ranged-based magic was an interesting game mechanic that bosses had and players have never had a way to use this other than the saradomin sword spec which is not something that you can use consistently (SS could use another buff too at some point, maybe the blessed sword could target mage defense?).\n\nMy idea was that since the DT questline and mahjarrat questlines in general involve deception and manipulation, then maybe the prayer book could reflect this in some way?\n\nHow about a series of prayers that convert your accuracy roll from a weapon and let you hit an opponents other defensive stats?\n\nLet's say, there is a prayer called \"Null Blade\" or something like that (Maybe \"Null Dart\" could be the ranged version). The prayer would have a similar drain rate as piety and would take your melee attack and roll against the opponent's magic defense. The melee example isn't super interesting, it would just result in higher DPS against barrow brothers type enemies that have awful magic defense and excellent melee defense. Where I think it would be interesting is converting magic to crush or ranged or the other way around ranged ---&gt; magic which lets you play with varied attack speeds and attack ranges.\n\nPerhaps this effect could be limited to certain weapons as well if we find that a magic based blowpipe is too powerful. That could maybe breathe some life back into thrown darts or standard spells. In general, I am against complicating these prayers any further than I already have. But if a good solution comes along, I would be all for it. It would be nice to read the prayer tooltip and immediately understand what the prayer does and what it works with, but not necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple flaws I want to address right now;\n\nThe power imbalance would be very noticable if you were able to use magic attacks with insane ranged or melee levels of accuracy so maybe as an alternative idea, when you convert your melee damage to magic it will use your magic accuracy instead of your melee accuracy. This would encourage wearing robes with a melee weapon to take advantage of the bonus. I don't like this change as much because then the only stats you keep from the original weapon are it's attack speed and attack range, but it wouldn't break the way boss's defenses are currently designed.\n\nUnfortunately, this would encourage one weapon type and just switching prayers to attack the correct weakness. While this is already done with flicking protection prayers on the defensive, I think a core part of the game is shifting gear setups to adapt to your situation and I wouldn't want to remove that aspect. If anyone has any suggestions to work around this I would be glad to hear them.\n\nAs for PVP, it would be a little unfair to be able to change combat styles on someone without actually changing the appearance of your gear. My only solution to this would just be leaving the damage-type the same. So regardless of which stat the attack targets, praying ranged against a ranged weapon will reduce the damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne final idea I just had while writing is an overhead prayer (sort of like smite) that would convert all of your damage to typeless (like the brassican mage), you wouldn't be able to use any protection prayers, but your opponent's prayers wouldn't work either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nNew prayer book suggestion for a series of prayers that would change the accuracy roll of your weapon to a different type (melee attacks target magic defense). This is similar to how bloodveld attacks function and ideally there would be conversions for other combat styles too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you did read all of my ramblings thank you. If not, I don't blame you. Just wanted to throw an idea out there and I would appreciate any input you could provide as well as some of your own ideas too!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10551fk\/new_dt2_prayer_book_suggestions_damage_type\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10551fk\/new_dt2_prayer_book_suggestions_damage_type\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:47 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"How I imagine what prayer switching is like in the infernal Jads wave.","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105524g\/how_i_imagine_what_prayer_switching_is_like_in\/","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/4l8xq3o71jaa1","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:48 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Impressive coordination","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10552xx\/impressive_coordination\/","url":"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/shorts\/QBL3RYF_kMk","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:49 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Died to a stupid mistake while getting my mouse for a sweet night slay and chill after a long day of work.

This is because, while it is an excellent weapon, it typically only is *marginally* better than the next BIS, but the next BIS never has a cost-per-attack.\n\nTake cerb for example. Scythe is BIS here, achieving 10.12787 dps for max stats\/gear, but its cost of use reduces the gp\/hr profit by &gt;33%, according to the wiki.

Both shadow and tbow have comparable costs to their 2nd BIS, thus leading to both of them being much more frequently seen around Gielinor.

For lost tribe, it requires 13 agility (boostable, so boost calculations could be done for minimum agility) 13 thieving (boostable) and 17 mining.  In addition, goblin diplomacy would need to be done, and that would force me to have 200 crafting xp.

Farming.\n\nFarming herbs has a low time commitment, and can profit up to 325k per run at max levels!\n\nOur current goal will be 32 Farming for Ranarr weeds.

Recipe for Disaster\/Another Cook's Quest (For Goblin Generals)\n\n2. Recipe for Disaster\/Freeing the Goblin generals (1000 Farming XP)\n\n3. Lost City (For Fairytale I)\n\n4. Nature Spirit (For Fairytale I)\n\n5. Fairytale I - Growing Pains (3500 Farming XP)\n\n\t(Learning how to flinch the final boss, tangleroot can be useful at low HP levels)\n\n6. Fight Arena (For thieving XP for Giant Dwarf, and amazing attack XP)\n\n6. The Giant Dwarf (For Forgettable Tale)\n\n7. Fishing Contest (For Forgettable Tale)\n\n8. Forgettable Tale (5000 Farming XP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point you will be Level 26 Farming with 9500 XP and have a choice to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're enjoying questing and want to continue (recommended):\n\n9. Priest in Peril (For Creature of Fenkenstrain)\n\n10. Either Steal Cakes in East Ardougne Until 25 Thieving or do \n\n\t1. Hazeel Cult\n\n\t2. Biohazard (Plague City Required but highly recommended)\n\n\t3. Tribal Totem\n\n11. Creature of Fenkenstrain (For Garden of Tranquility)\n\n12. Garden of Tranquility (5000 Farming XP)\n\n13. Enlightened Journey (3000 Farming XP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, begin doing tree and fruit tree runs until level 32 Farming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongratulations! You are now 32 farming and can start to farm Ranarr weeds!\n\nHowever, there are still a few more things that can be done to help make your herb runs more efficient!\n\n1. Get 25 Agility by running laps or by completing the following Quests:\n\n\t1. Recruitment Drive\n\n\t2. The Tourist Trap (use the experience on Agility 2x)\n\n\t3. The Depths of Despair\n\n\t4. The Grand Tree (Not required for 25, but Highly Recommended)\n\n2. Complete Ghosts Ahoy (For access to ectophial)\n\n3. Get 25 Construction and move POH to Hosidius\n\n4. Get at least 50% Hosidius favor so that the patch never gets diseased\n\n5. Eventually Complete My Arm's Big Adventure\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne finaly ingredient that you can do to help your profit is to make ultracompost. Here's how:\n\n1. Buy a bunch of watermelon from the GE (or grow them yourself at 47 Farming)\n\n2. Also buy a bunch of volcanic ash (or go get it yourself after bone voyage, Not Recommended)\n\n2. Fill all of the compost bins that are near to a bank (Catherby, Hosidius, Farming Guild, Morytania)\n\n3. While you're doing that, give the gnome storage a bunch of empty buckets (these can be noted)\n\n4. Close the compost bins once they are full and wait \\~90 minutes\n\n5. Once completed, go back to the bins, open them, add the volcanic ash, and store it in your buckets\n\n6. Repeat as often as possible. I would NOT run herbs without ultracompost\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhew! We Made it! That was a lot of work but now we can finally start running herbs! Here's how:\n\n1. Falador Patch\n\n\tTeleport to Draynor with a Glory Amulet (can be mounted in POH for infinite charges, or can use Explorer Ring 2+)\n\n2. Morytania Patch\n\n\tTeleport with Ectophial and Run West\n\n3. Catherby Patch\n\n\tTeleport to Camelot and Run East\n\n4. Ardougne Patch\n\n\tTeleport to Ardougne and Run North\n\n5. Hosidius Patch\n\n\tTeleport to House (Right-Click Outside!) and run North\n\n6. Troll Stronghold Patch (If unlocked)\n\n\tTrollheim Teleport and run west\n\n\t\n\nRake or harvest the patch (EQUIP THE MAGIC SECATEURS), plant the seed, and add ultracompost\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt level 32 Farming and 5 patches, you will profit about 100k per run when farming Ranarrs\n\nAt 6 patches, this goes up to about 125k per run.\n\nRuns can be completed every 90 minutes. If you're efficient you can do 8 runs a day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can calculate which seed will be most profitable to run using the tool on the wiki here: [https:\/\/oldschool.runescape.wiki\/w\/Calculator:Farming\/Herbs](https:\/\/oldschool.runescape.wiki\/w\/Calculator:Farming\/Herbs)\n\n\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some next-steps that can help improve profit per herb run!\n\n1. Continue doing Tree and Fruit tree runs until 65 Farming and get 60% Hosidius favor for Farming Guild Patch\n\n2. Complete the medium (or hard!) Lumbridge\/Draynor achievement Diary for access to Falador Farm Teleport\n\n3. Complete the medium (or hard!) Ardougne achievement diary for a teleport to the Ardy Farm patch\n\n4. Complete Making Friends with My Arm for Weiss Patch.\n\n5. Complete Elite Morytania Diary for Harmony Island Patch\n\n6. A bottomless bucket can be a great quality of life upgrade if you can afford it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome more notes:\n\n30 Agility gives you 60% faster run energy regeneration. It is worth getting early.\n\nFarming is great because it gives you time to do other content that you enjoy while still making money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink of these steps more as a loose roadmap and not a strict guide.

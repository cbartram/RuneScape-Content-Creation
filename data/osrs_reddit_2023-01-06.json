On any given island there can a number of pve encounters:\n\n1. World bosses (bosses that anyone can attack with anyone else on a world, like gwd bosses).\n2. Dungeons (bosses that can only be fought in an instance either solo, or in a team).\n\nYour regular gear, weapons and armour won't work on these islands. You'll need to help the communities there in order to be rewarded with new gear that can be used on the various islands.\n\n# LOOT MECHANICS\n\nLoot from these encounters will be dropped in a similar way to Nex. Each time you complete a pve encounter, the rewards you can receive include weapons, armour and resources.\n\nLoot is rolled per player, meaning that more than 1 person can receive the same unique and there can be multiple uniques dropped per kc. There will be a damage threshold that grants better odds than the base rate for uniques if you surpass it.\n\nAll weapons and armour items will be untradable to players other than the group you were with (and only for 1 hour to them). Materials, resources, etc will be tradable to others but will be important to collect.\n\n# Account progression\n\nEach time you complete a dungeon, you will have the option to scale up the encounter like an enrage mechanic where specific stats are modified to make the encounters more difficult. So think cox, then cox 2, then cox 3 and so on.\n\nEvery 5 levels you ascend, you will be introduced to new mechanics. Every 10 levels you scale, you will be rewarded with a new unique drop table that features upgrades to your weapons and armour as well as more resources that can be crafted into weapons and armour if you didn't get them as a drop (but crafted default gear won't be as good as awarded drops of your tier), and those resources can later enhance your gear to make them even better. Clearing the encounters also awards sailing skill experience as does the crafting and enhancing of gear.\n\nThe weapons and armour you can be awarded, craft and upgrade are both hand weapon slots, gloves, amulets, head, chest, legs, boots, cape, and ring.\n\n# Tradable loot\n\nAt a raid scale of 20 (max scale) for an island, the new loot table you gain access to includes tradable rewards. These are able to buff your existing weapons and armour, granting them unique stats and effects.\n\nYou have to have an existing set of island specific weapon and armour to even buff them with these rewards and they only enhance that level. Meaning if you used the tradable rewards to buff your current gear that is only at a level 10 tier and replaced that gear with better items at level 15 or level 20, then you'd have to get more of those tradable rewards to buff the new gear set you have. Making them forever useful to yourself and other players that are interested in higher level pve encounters.\n\n# Summary\n\nYou explore dungeons and take on world bosses to continually upgrade untradable zone specific gear with tradable resources. The world bosses have immense health and deal a relatively good amount of dps, requiring you to fight in a team. After completing a dungeon, you are awarded weapons, armour, resources and given the option to scale up the dungeon for better and more effective loot. The higher you go, the better the untradable weapon and armour rewards. There's tradable rewards as well that enhance your gear.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10533fc\/how_the_new_skill_could_create_an_entirely_new\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10533fc\/how_the_new_skill_could_create_an_entirely_new\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 02:30 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"100 Laps with Penguin facts daily until agility pet - Day 93","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10536l1\/100_laps_with_penguin_facts_daily_until_agility\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/c0izz6q0oiaa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 02:34 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"osrs!! group and HCIM GROUP ROOM","content":"Discord: Shmerk\n\nLooking for friends and shit to watch videos and just chat with on the side too! network and share stuff, but to the point!\n\nI started a hardcore ironman group with another person, and i made 3 extra accounts, im looking to give these accounts out to other people that want to join the team, they will get to change email and password and stuff, we just ask that you give us the information back if you are going to quit, once we get all comfortable with each other we will be able to share the information freely, but for now the HARDCORE STATUS IS ALL THAT MATTERS!!!

But this begs the question, what if we had a similar skill, but with its own identity and balancing? Now fair warning, I'm going to be spitballing a lot of ideas here with the intention of using feedback I receive to refine this idea much like a lot of other suggestions I've seen on here. So here we go:\n\nEnter the Taming skill, a skill where you traverse Gielinor to earn the loyalty of the  world's various creatures. As the skill progresses, you're able to tame  more and more powerful creatures to aid you in skilling and combat.  This could be a great way to reintroduce a lot of the summoning pet animals  like squirrels, the different breeds of dogs, monkeys and maybe even the God Birds like the Zamorak Hawk as well? \n\nSo, how would such a skill's gameplay loop work? When beginning to train Taming, you would receive a dog to start the skill with. Dogs would have some combat use, albeit a weak one, but to start with it'll suffice to help you get the first few levels. After your first few levels gained from Fido chomping the green behinds of many a goblin, you're able to start taming new animals. First you would need to create or buy treats using cooking and specialized traps made with crafting to hold the creature in place and tame it. You would then need to choose the correct interaction in order to gain the creature's trust. In order to 'summon'  it, you'd create a magic whistle that you bind to the creature you've just gained the trust of to call your new companion forward. Combat companions would need to be healed via food if damaged in combat, and if they die, another needs to be captured. (Though you could have the excuse to add a new Arceuus Spell to resurrect fallen followers) Followers also cannot remain out indefinitely however, as they need rest just like we do!  An animal's energy would renew overtime when not in use as to provide one avenue of balancing. Another balance to discuss of course, and maybe the elephant in the room for some when Summoning was mentioned is the BoBs, which get stupid OP in RS3 at high summoning levels. Perhaps here, certain animal companions would be able to be equipped with degradable satchels made with crafting that offer a few extra slots, but with nowhere near as much as something like the yaks or mammoths of RS3.\n\nSo here's an additional idea. Companions could have randomized stats, with a very small chance for one stat being perfect, and extremely low chance of all of them being so. What's a way to afk this is so you're not tearing your hair out taming every single unicorn in the world to get the one horse to rule them all? Breeding. Perhaps ranches throughout the world could serve as places to shelter your beloved companions in order to get the chance for the perfect creature. So, you've just received your bulldog with perfect stats and...it's outclassed by the Bear you've just tamed near Varrock. What do you do with your pooch now? Enter collars, an item you can only use on a companion with perfect stats to irreversibly transform them into Pets. Again, part of the idea here is the introduction of pets that were beloved back in the pre-OSRS days, but in this way, they're more of an achievement than simply hatching an egg or buying one.\n\nOverall, the idea is to create a skill based somewhat on Summoning, with it's own skill interactions and with it's own identity and balancing. Not to mention that such a skill could well and truly interact with every other skill, but in the creation of items and the bonuses provided from your companions. With certain pets aiding in skilling (think Monkeys for Agility or thieving.)  and others aiding in combat. That's all I really have for now. Feedback is much appreciated, as this is something of a rough draft of an idea and is not at all polished.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10543cm\/taming_skill\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10543cm\/taming_skill\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:09 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Loot from 14 goblins","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1054439\/loot_from_14_goblins\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/hfme96xiuiaa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:10 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Double drop from Zulrah 19 kills after pulling a Magic Fang.

The chance of a mark spawning also goes down by a factor of 5 if you're 20+ Agility levels above the course requirement.\n\nHere's the weird part: probably due to a bug, not only is the base mark-of-grace rate **twice as high** for Canifis as it is for the similar level courses (Falador, Varrock, etc), but also **the 5x nerf if you're too high level doesn't apply at all to Canifis**. So in practice, doing Canifis at level 99 (or any level really) will give a 67% chance at a mark, even though it should probably be more like 6.7%. 10 times lower.\n\nOverall this doesn't result in anything quite as crazy as twice as many marks per hour from Canifis versus the others (the 3 minute cooldown helps even it out a bit), but it does mean that Canifis is always at least 50% better than Falador for marks, and remains the best course in the entire game (~18.2 per hour) until you've done the elite Ardougne diary (~22.0 per hour).\n\n[Here's a graph](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/517605269849636864\/1060417159265800224\/chrome_J5Ie2xDWqb.png) of the marks per hour you can expect if you do each course without failure, in the appropriate level band - remember that all of them (except Canifis) additionally get nerfed hard if you go 20 levels above the requirement.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550wn\/fun_fact_canifis_is_always_the_best_rooftop\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550wn\/fun_fact_canifis_is_always_the_best_rooftop\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:46 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"My account was banned for no reason","content":"[removed]","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550yp\/my_account_was_banned_for_no_reason\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10550yp\/my_account_was_banned_for_no_reason\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:46 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Anyone part of the Black Arm gang that I can trade to complete Shield of Arrav?

For example, we lose the ability to protect 100% against a combat style (maybe only 50% instead), but gain some other combat buffs which are more substantial than the standard book.\n\nOn to my idea. I always thought that having a magic-based melee attack or ranged-based magic was an interesting game mechanic that bosses had and players have never had a way to use this other than the saradomin sword spec which is not something that you can use consistently (SS could use another buff too at some point, maybe the blessed sword could target mage defense?).\n\nMy idea was that since the DT questline and mahjarrat questlines in general involve deception and manipulation, then maybe the prayer book could reflect this in some way?\n\nHow about a series of prayers that convert your accuracy roll from a weapon and let you hit an opponents other defensive stats?\n\nLet's say, there is a prayer called \"Null Blade\" or something like that (Maybe \"Null Dart\" could be the ranged version). The prayer would have a similar drain rate as piety and would take your melee attack and roll against the opponent's magic defense. The melee example isn't super interesting, it would just result in higher DPS against barrow brothers type enemies that have awful magic defense and excellent melee defense. Where I think it would be interesting is converting magic to crush or ranged or the other way around ranged ---&gt; magic which lets you play with varied attack speeds and attack ranges.\n\nPerhaps this effect could be limited to certain weapons as well if we find that a magic based blowpipe is too powerful. That could maybe breathe some life back into thrown darts or standard spells. In general, I am against complicating these prayers any further than I already have. But if a good solution comes along, I would be all for it. It would be nice to read the prayer tooltip and immediately understand what the prayer does and what it works with, but not necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple flaws I want to address right now;\n\nThe power imbalance would be very noticable if you were able to use magic attacks with insane ranged or melee levels of accuracy so maybe as an alternative idea, when you convert your melee damage to magic it will use your magic accuracy instead of your melee accuracy. This would encourage wearing robes with a melee weapon to take advantage of the bonus. I don't like this change as much because then the only stats you keep from the original weapon are it's attack speed and attack range, but it wouldn't break the way boss's defenses are currently designed.\n\nUnfortunately, this would encourage one weapon type and just switching prayers to attack the correct weakness. While this is already done with flicking protection prayers on the defensive, I think a core part of the game is shifting gear setups to adapt to your situation and I wouldn't want to remove that aspect. If anyone has any suggestions to work around this I would be glad to hear them.\n\nAs for PVP, it would be a little unfair to be able to change combat styles on someone without actually changing the appearance of your gear. My only solution to this would just be leaving the damage-type the same. So regardless of which stat the attack targets, praying ranged against a ranged weapon will reduce the damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne final idea I just had while writing is an overhead prayer (sort of like smite) that would convert all of your damage to typeless (like the brassican mage), you wouldn't be able to use any protection prayers, but your opponent's prayers wouldn't work either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nNew prayer book suggestion for a series of prayers that would change the accuracy roll of your weapon to a different type (melee attacks target magic defense). This is similar to how bloodveld attacks function and ideally there would be conversions for other combat styles too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you did read all of my ramblings thank you. If not, I don't blame you. Just wanted to throw an idea out there and I would appreciate any input you could provide as well as some of your own ideas too!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10551fk\/new_dt2_prayer_book_suggestions_damage_type\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10551fk\/new_dt2_prayer_book_suggestions_damage_type\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:47 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"How I imagine what prayer switching is like in the infernal Jads wave.","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105524g\/how_i_imagine_what_prayer_switching_is_like_in\/","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/4l8xq3o71jaa1","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-06 03:48 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-06"},{"title":"Died to a stupid mistake while getting my mouse for a sweet night slay and chill after a long day of work.

This is because, while it is an excellent weapon, it typically only is *marginally* better than the next BIS, but the next BIS never has a cost-per-attack.\n\nTake cerb for example. Scythe is BIS here, achieving 10.12787 dps for max stats\/gear, but its cost of use reduces the gp\/hr profit by &gt;33%, according to the wiki. This cost is quite hard to justify when the 2nd to BIS weapon (inquisitor's mace and avernic defender) achieves a comparable 9.04418 dps.\n\nOut of the 'mega-weapons', Scythe's cost-of-use problem is unqiue. Both shadow and tbow have comparable costs to their 2nd BIS, thus leading to both of them being much more frequently seen around Gielinor. This problem is reflected in Scythe's price, only ~370m, compared to the other two which are ~1.3b each.\n\n\nOne solution would be a perma-charge option, like for bowfa. It could be extremely expensive, to the point that most people wouldn't \"get their money's worth\", but would encourage more use of the scythe.

For lost tribe, it requires 13 agility (boostable, so boost calculations could be done for minimum agility) 13 thieving (boostable) and 17 mining.

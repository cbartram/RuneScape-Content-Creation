Not me\n\nIf anyone is thinking about paying for an infernal cape from one of these dodgy sites. DON\u2019T. I used infernal-services.com, they made me download software so they had remote access to my computer. At the time I thought it was a good idea, they didn\u2019t need my log in credentials and used my IP address. Before I knew it, I was in Lummy with an empty inventory, scammed for around 1.5B (T-bow). \nMy circumstances have changed, I have two kids now and can only play in my lunch hour. The thought of dedicating 50+ hours to get the cape, I just couldn\u2019t do and wanted the easy out. No excuse, I got scammed and had my pants down. \nSo if you\u2019re thinking similar to me (I hope you\u2019re not, but people do). Just grind it out and learn it yourself, or let someone do it you truly trust. \nFor me, I\u2019m going to be happy with my fire cape, still have an 800m bank, but losing my bow stings like a mofo, so I\u2019m going to take a long break - maybe start a HCIM I\u2019m not sure yet. \nBefore all the comments roast me (which I deserve and will take on the chin like Lisa Ann), I know.

The skill would be a lot like creating words on items to change them so it kind of fits.\n\n**What does it do:**\n\n\\-Allow players to change armor and weapons through sort of ''imbuing'' them into having different qualities or stats. The skill would open the possibility to alter drop table of monsters to have some type of drops more common, just outright or with some added negative(s) and to change stats of armor and weapons to make them more effective in certain activities or against certain enemies (like demonbane weapons).\n\nThe skill would also affect resource gathering from skilling by offering an alternative to skilling outfits (instead of exp you get slightly more resources)\n\n**How would it work:**\n\n\\-The skill would be done either through spells cast straight on the items (requires runes for example) or through tablets created that can then be used on items of the player's choice. With tablets, it could require different combination tablets to get certain effects, equivalent to casting requiring different rune combinations.\n\n\\-The effects would be temporary, either time or charge based. Alternatively they could be constant yet removable (all actions would grant experience).\n\n\\-Possibly having only certain type of items be able to have certain effects. On items that can be made through smithing, the item could also be consumed once the effects end (would require the effects to be temporary) which would create an item sink and thus a demand for smithing.\n\n**Effects to gameplay:**\n\n\\-The skill would challenge players and give an alternative to 'BiS in everything' method of bossing. For example you could have mystic armor make certain Zulrah drops more common which would force you to use lower tier gear in exchange for slightly more common drops. This could be based on a set bonus for example so having more items of the armor set on would have a bigger effect.\n\n\\-The skill could be tied to resource gathering by allowing players to make alternatives to skilling outfits. Instead of exp gains you could change an outfit\/armor set to give x% of more resources.\n\n**Training:**\n\n\\-If the skill would be to create tablets in the same way as runecrafting, training could be two-part; Creating those tablets would grant some experience and additional experience would be gained when they are used on an item.\n\n\\-If the skill would be to cast the spells straight on items, training could be more tied to smithing by having the players train early levels by casting on low tier armor and weapons like Bronze, Iron and Steel.\n\n**Positives for the players and game:**\n\n\\-Challenge players and create variety in the game, both PvMing and skilling.\n\n\\-Make smithing more useful apart from just making few items like darts.\n\n\\-Ironmen would benefit to an extent either by having faster resources or by slightly lowering the grind for gear improvements.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105oau0\/new_skill_suggestion_tied_to_pvming_resource\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105oau0\/new_skill_suggestion_tied_to_pvming_resource\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 07:49 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Ancient Prayers Ideas (Gnomonkey) What do you think?","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105odwb\/ancient_prayers_ideas_gnomonkey_what_do_you_think\/","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bJsOQWJY45Q","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 07:54 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"How To Become The Doom Slayer In OSRS","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ot8c\/how_to_become_the_doom_slayer_in_osrs\/","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-GlOFbrgYWE","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:16 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"People that pvm ok are such trolls with no life it\u2019s that simple idc what you say please seek help","content":"Gratz on the 100-500k a hour supply you burn should be losing money hopefully trolling makes up for it seriously I\u2019ve played a lot of games never found such trolls other then ones that pvm pk","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ovhm\/people_that_pvm_ok_are_such_trolls_with_no_life\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ovhm\/people_that_pvm_ok_are_such_trolls_with_no_life\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:19 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Is there a better grid plugin than the standard one?","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ox1o\/is_there_a_better_grid_plugin_than_the_standard\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/szj57puwgmaa1.png","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:22 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"First time Jad","content":"I've been procrastinating doing Fight Caves, but think today may be the day.

My account has this weird rng where some drops i get insanely lucky. Best RNG probably has been Phoenix pet at 6KC Wintertodt. Im currently 66 Firemaking and haven\u2019t touched Wintertodt since. If and when i eventually want to max, i can\u2019t see myself doing regular log burning till 99.\n\nWhat would you guys do? I don\u2019t necessarily see it as a flex as i post osrs from my burner account, but it\u2019s pretty cool seeing the collection log every now and then.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105p5ye\/would_you_never_touch_wintertodt_again_if_you_got\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105p5ye\/would_you_never_touch_wintertodt_again_if_you_got\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:34 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Finally got my first pet!","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105p6xx\/finally_got_my_first_pet\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/0bsquykwimaa1.png","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:36 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"How do i make a pure without spending hundreds of hours levelling","content":"Hey so i want to make a pure to start pking (mostly in wildy) but all the guides i have seen say you need to have 80+ stats. Just 85 mage would take me around 250 hrs of splashing, which is completely ridiculous considering i just want to try out pking outside of lms.\n\nSo is there any other way that doesnt steal all my free time, or should i just give up on the idea? Is there a lower levelled build thats viable \/ faster way to level, even if its just to learn and maybe kill some bots.

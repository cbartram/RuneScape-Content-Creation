The skill would be a lot like creating words on items to change them so it kind of fits.\n\n**What does it do:**\n\n\\-Allow players to change armor and weapons through sort of ''imbuing'' them into having different qualities or stats. The skill would open the possibility to alter drop table of monsters to have some type of drops more common, just outright or with some added negative(s) and to change stats of armor and weapons to make them more effective in certain activities or against certain enemies (like demonbane weapons).\n\nThe skill would also affect resource gathering from skilling by offering an alternative to skilling outfits (instead of exp you get slightly more resources)\n\n**How would it work:**\n\n\\-The skill would be done either through spells cast straight on the items (requires runes for example) or through tablets created that can then be used on items of the player's choice. With tablets, it could require different combination tablets to get certain effects, equivalent to casting requiring different rune combinations.\n\n\\-The effects would be temporary, either time or charge based. Alternatively they could be constant yet removable (all actions would grant experience).\n\n\\-Possibly having only certain type of items be able to have certain effects. On items that can be made through smithing, the item could also be consumed once the effects end (would require the effects to be temporary) which would create an item sink and thus a demand for smithing.\n\n**Effects to gameplay:**\n\n\\-The skill would challenge players and give an alternative to 'BiS in everything' method of bossing. For example you could have mystic armor make certain Zulrah drops more common which would force you to use lower tier gear in exchange for slightly more common drops. This could be based on a set bonus for example so having more items of the armor set on would have a bigger effect.\n\n\\-The skill could be tied to resource gathering by allowing players to make alternatives to skilling outfits. Instead of exp gains you could change an outfit\/armor set to give x% of more resources.\n\n**Training:**\n\n\\-If the skill would be to create tablets in the same way as runecrafting, training could be two-part; Creating those tablets would grant some experience and additional experience would be gained when they are used on an item.\n\n\\-If the skill would be to cast the spells straight on items, training could be more tied to smithing by having the players train early levels by casting on low tier armor and weapons like Bronze, Iron and Steel.\n\n**Positives for the players and game:**\n\n\\-Challenge players and create variety in the game, both PvMing and skilling.\n\n\\-Make smithing more useful apart from just making few items like darts.\n\n\\-Ironmen would benefit to an extent either by having faster resources or by slightly lowering the grind for gear improvements.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105oau0\/new_skill_suggestion_tied_to_pvming_resource\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105oau0\/new_skill_suggestion_tied_to_pvming_resource\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 07:49 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Ancient Prayers Ideas (Gnomonkey) What do you think?","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105odwb\/ancient_prayers_ideas_gnomonkey_what_do_you_think\/","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bJsOQWJY45Q","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 07:54 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Selling Larrans keys - 400k each","content":"Pm me ingame if needed - S E R G E N - pm","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1065faq\/selling_larrans_keys_400k_each\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1065faq\/selling_larrans_keys_400k_each\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:07 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"How To Become The Doom Slayer In OSRS","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ot8c\/how_to_become_the_doom_slayer_in_osrs\/","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-GlOFbrgYWE","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:16 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"People that pvm ok are such trolls with no life it\u2019s that simple idc what you say please seek help","content":"Gratz on the 100-500k a hour supply you burn should be losing money hopefully trolling makes up for it seriously I\u2019ve played a lot of games never found such trolls other then ones that pvm pk","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ovhm\/people_that_pvm_ok_are_such_trolls_with_no_life\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ovhm\/people_that_pvm_ok_are_such_trolls_with_no_life\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:19 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Bot train busted at stronghold of security","content":"In almost every world there is a ~60 combat in mightily armor at the flesh crawlers on floor 2, SE corner.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1065pkt\/bot_train_busted_at_stronghold_of_security\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1065pkt\/bot_train_busted_at_stronghold_of_security\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:20 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"Is there a better grid plugin than the standard one?","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105ox1o\/is_there_a_better_grid_plugin_than_the_standard\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/szj57puwgmaa1.png","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 08:22 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"First time Jad","content":"I've been procrastinating doing Fight Caves, but think today may be the day.

The graphics I can explain away but the run energy is a continual pain point and I have no explanation for it other than just being an archaic system and telling them to get on with it. But it drains super fast and regens incredibly slow on a new account and most of the time, my friends have chosen ironman over main even when I've explained the differences.

I'm specifically thinking about the hp cape, since that's what I'm working toward atm. 400 hours to get it and it's all but useless by the time you do. Or 99 agility just for shits and giggles. Or 99 construction so you have a great house immediately. You could put them on their own worlds, maybe even have a totally separate or even no ge. Make it mandatory iron? I'm sure there are huge downsides I'm overlooking but idc, I want it.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105tzyv\/id_kill_for_a_ng_mode\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105tzyv\/id_kill_for_a_ng_mode\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 12:09 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"this beer is only half as good as everyone says it is","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105u0i4\/this_beer_is_only_half_as_good_as_everyone_says\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ph32x2483paa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 12:10 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!!!","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/105u4w9\/its_clobbering_time\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/iduh56njmnaa1.png","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-07 12:15 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-07"},{"title":"PLEAE HELP!

The restrictions on region access, teleports, and quest\/diary buffs, are all bummers, but still overall a positive experience.\n\nThe only problem I'm running into is having money for buyables. Lower level herbs pay for basic supplies, but it'll be awhile before I have decent moneymakers. Dragon pick and harpoon are a bit out of my budget for now.\n\nHave you guys ever tried a skiller?

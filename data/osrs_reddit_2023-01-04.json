So this got me thinking that it might be interesting to compare the number of players who have hit [drop rate](https:\/\/oldschool.runescape.wiki\/w\/Dragon_pickaxe#Item_sources) for the pick at each respective boss that drops\/will drop it, to get a very rough sense of how popular each of these bosses really is. Rounding to the nearest thousand:\n\n* 25,000 people have at least 171 KC at Callisto\n* 10,000 people have at least 171 KC at Vet'ion\n* 35,000 people have at least 171 KC at Venenatis\n* 13,000 people have at least 256 KC at Chaos Elemental\n* 10,000 people have at least 1500 KC at King Black Dragon\n* 20,000 people have at least 400 KC at Kalphite Queen\n\nObviously this doesn't paint a complete picture without also analyzing how many people are ranked at various other points, and also comparing how many of those accounts are mains vs irons, but from this very preliminary dataset I can't imagine that adding the boss to KQ (one of the worst bosses in the game to kill) or VM (which seems to be content 95+% of the playerbase has never touched), will cause the price to crater much at all. The only reason mains have to do KQ besides the elite diary and CAs is pet hunting, and the iron men who choose to go this route might find themselves trying the Wilderness bosses after all that once they realize how terrible KQ is. As to VM, unless someone is specifically doing all their mining training there, I don't imagine this will account for many picks coming into the game either. D pick is still the 2nd best pickaxe for mining and the best pickaxe at CoX and ToA, hence the current prices.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103at2c\/dragon_pickaxe_vs_boss_kc_minianalysis\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103at2c\/dragon_pickaxe_vs_boss_kc_minianalysis\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:23 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Why I can't just buy the abyssal needle with abyssal pearls?","content":"Little update. 91 RC and 2000 searches I'm out.

Come take a look at the most insane streak of RNG I have experienced in OSRS.","content":"\n5 months ago my main was a very solid late mid game account. I was 1900 total level or so with a quest cape and a net worth of around 150m. While mulling over goals for my account, a very experience friend suggested learning corrupted gauntlet to dip my toes in to more difficult mechanics and continue to build my account. I committed to running CG's and nothing else until I had a Bowfa, with the expectation I'd probably buy it first before getting the drop (This is a terrible idea BTW. Do not do this if you are normal sane person and want to keep enjoying the game).  After seeing some horror stories here about people going hundreds or even thousands dry I wasn't expecting much. My expectations were shattered when I got the [Enhanced drop at 170](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dYgVQur.png).  \n\n\nI think mod Ash was smiling upon me that day, because apart from a few exceptions every single boss I have fought since then have been raining down uniques left and right. The first example happened literally the next day. I took my shiny new bowfa over to Sara to start my first ever GWD grind. [This was a very good idea](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/p9bgSuQ.png). All of a sudden within the span of less than a week my net worth had more than doubled. I wanted to continue to test my RNG so I made a goal of grinding slayer and learning every slayer boss.  \n\n\nSo I dumped all that new gold into gear and got to work. Cerb was first up, and he let me know right away the [streak](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fkNqmVq.png) was still going. For a few weeks the [drops](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rUas25h.png) ... [kept](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tttCCDT.png) ... [coming](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/x4z6sak.png). I felt like an RNG god. I could not be stopped. Abyssal Sire was the only one who refused to bow down to my luck boon, giving me no drops for the 58 kills it took to finish his combat achievements. (Honestly the feeling is mutual, Sire sucks). [Thermy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hKfbkzb.png) was just weird. 3 days ago I finally achieved my goal. I got to 95 slayer and was assigned a Hydra task (first task from Konar BTW). All it took was a single task to re-open the [drop floodgates](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0csVlla.png). What a way to finish this adventure. I'm hoping the streak continues and I can provide another update down the line. Jagex tried their best, but I am letting my sub lapse for a few months despite the gains I have made. Hopefully one of you can borrow my luck while I am gone.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103avfb\/im_taking_a_break_from_rs_for_school_but_before_i\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103avfb\/im_taking_a_break_from_rs_for_school_but_before_i\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:25 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Why I can't just buy the abyssal needle with abyssal pearls?","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103aum9\/why_i_cant_just_buy_the_abyssal_needle_with\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/2b6xjz9bk2aa1.png","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:25 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Rsn: ddsfoottatt","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103aylc\/rsn_ddsfoottatt\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/kclbg0vl24aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:29 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Add chess to ge","content":"Would fit medieval theme, could also add elo","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102wdoz\/add_chess_to_ge\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102wdoz\/add_chess_to_ge\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:39 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"It\u2019s been almost 4 months since the release of TOA, how do u feel about the content now?","content":"And how has your opinion changed since release?\n\nFor me this place has aged like milk, and I feel the sentiment is shared for a lot of people, while it\u2019s very good for PVM beginners to learn the basics, the fights themselves really lack a lot of depth, couple that with unavoidable chip damage thru prayer and double dipped HP\/defence scaling with higher invocations and it really starts to feel pretty crappy.\n\nBut I\u2019m probably just coping cuz I\u2019m dry there how do u feel?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102weca\/its_been_almost_4_months_since_the_release_of_toa\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102weca\/its_been_almost_4_months_since_the_release_of_toa\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:40 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"IRL D-Med","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103bdda\/irl_dmed\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/pbskzeze54aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 01:45 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Group Ironman","content":"Ill be the first to admit I don't have many friends left that enjoy playing OSRS.

They would chat with players around them, asking questions and sometimes having deep conversations. They could cooperate with other players to achieve goals. They would join clans and complete cooperative quests. They would PvP, and even appear to get mad upon losing, and cheer upon winning.\n\nIf bots had to be this deep to exist without detection, would you enjoy their inclusion?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103dyv1\/philosophical_question_about_botting\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103dyv1\/philosophical_question_about_botting\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 03:25 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Reddit Customer Support Roulette: Locked Account Please Help!","content":"Hoping that I can win big at the Reddit customer support casino and get some help to access my old account as I can\u2019t get past automated denials in the system which means no-one is reading the info in my recovery request. \n\nI created an Ironman a few years back using my work email.

I requested an email change to B on my jagex account because I can\u2019t access A (at least I thought at the time) because the hacker removed all my back up security options, took off my 2FA and secured email A with usb security keys. If you can\u2019t access your email, you have to submit a change request and provide as much account information\/payment history as you can. Jagex approves email change to B, and everything seems good. \n\nLater this day, I find out I\u2019m able to get limited access to my hacked email A on the computer that originally got compromised, because I was signed out and locked out on all devices from email A. Which is great because now I can change my email to all these other accounts I have. \n\nI look at my email and Jagex froze my RuneScape account, swapped the email back from B to A and sent an email to A to change my password. I don\u2019t know why Jagex would literally swap my email back to an email address I said was hacked and then proceed to make my Jagex account vulnerable. Luckily I was able to swap my email address and change the password, but if I didn\u2019t get lucky and get in my email with limited access, I would be locked out of my account right now with the potential of a hacker to get into my jagex account, when that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have happened.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1033ajn\/feedback_for_jagex_in_handling_my_account_recovery\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1033ajn\/feedback_for_jagex_in_handling_my_account_recovery\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 08:07 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Make Fashionscape Efficient","content":"Today's game is all about efficiency. When you walk around in the world all you see is players who basically look the same, all wearing the Graceful outfit. The consequence of this is that there is no variety and no room for creativity. It just gives this blank vibe imo.\n\nI remember back in the day, when everyone was a noob, fashionscape was a big part of the game. Cool kids in cool outfits chilling at Varrock Square. Although we probably won't be standing at the Square anymore, we can try to give the players the option to express themselves creatively in game, while at the same time being efficient. This would make the world more interesting than it is right now. We would see weird and cool outfits that people put together. Not the same boring outfit with a few recolors.\n\n**How could this be implemented?**\n\nMy (basic) proposal is as follows (although there are probably many ways to implement this): we should be able to give cosmetic items the same effects as the Graceful outfit. But ONLY cosmetic items. The set effect would only work if you would wear an 'imbued' cosmetic hat, top, legs, gloves, boots and cape. The weight reduction of the individual pieces of Graceful be the same for an 'imbued' cosmetic item (for example: an imbued Partyhat would have the same weight reduction as a Graceful hood).\n\n**Mechanics**\n\n- By making use of the Marks of Grace system: an X amount of Marks to 'imbue' a cosmetic item by talking to Grace.\n- A new 'special thread' that we could use on a cosmetic item to 'imbue' it.\n- Simply pay gold to 'imbue' the cosmetic item; this will function as a gold sink.\n\nPerhaps the team could make a short quest or miniquest involving Grace? In any case, the (skill) requirements should be minimal, so every player can join in on the fashionscape if they would want to.\n\nThoughts?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1033cbd\/make_fashionscape_efficient\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1033cbd\/make_fashionscape_efficient\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 08:10 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"I did witch's potion!!!","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1033e44\/i_did_witchs_potion\/","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/tXyO5TkKN4o","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 08:12 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"No update this week.

You must wait for my username response. The game cannot start until a username has been submitted by me. \n    \n    After you have received an input and the player has chosen a username, the game has started and should always show a single, unique code block, and always wait for me to enter the next command. I will type commands and dialogue, and you will only reply with what the game would output. I want you to reply with the game\u2019s output inside one short code block. Once the game has started, the game's output should be placed in a mark down code block, or in other words you just always place the game state in-between ``` characters. \n    \n    Once the game has started print \"{Username} logged into OSRS. Any commands you type will refer to this game\", then a new line \"---\" followed a description of the starting scene, Lumbridge written so elegantly I can picture the scene vividly using approximately 75 words and emojis. \n    \n     The game should always show \"Health:\", \" Inventory:\", \"Scene:\" which should show a 75 word minimum vivid description of the player's current location written in the second person and in the style of an OSRS text-based emoji adventure game, and a numbered list of 7 \"Possible actions\", including five options to advance the story, and \"6: Perform another action. Usage: \u20186 &lt;input an action&gt;\". \"7. View Levels\" (which you would then print out a mark down table of my levels) Inventory items should always include their quantity. Levels is a summary of the characters skill levels in a table format. Hitpoints\/constitution skill level starts at 10, others start at 1.\n    \n    Do not explain yourself. Do not type commands unless I ask you to. Do not run the program automatically. Wait for my input. It is essential that these rules are followed without exception. \n    \n    The initial \"scene\" will be the user arriving at Lumbridge. \n    Expand the scene with a 75 word description of the player\u2019s starting scene, in the second person and in the style of a text-based with emojis adventure game.\n    \n    Once an action has been set you will \"render\" the next scene with a new list of actions. \n    \n    Remember you're required to output the game in a Code block, and you're required to wait for my username before starting the game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Starting \\\\\"Scene\\\\\" ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ijf8twazf1aa1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4c7b10b09c620e22548b949179a278e292aeaf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zz4ist92g1aa1.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02661881d26d4fe7f842fa26b4f31f1501fa9153","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035aqo\/osrs_text_adventure_game_via_chatgpt\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035aqo\/osrs_text_adventure_game_via_chatgpt\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 09:43 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Make certain worlds capped gear in wilderness","content":"People have been complaining that all of the top pkers are in very high risk high DPS gear due to the the safety of the non PJing wilderness.\n\nI believe a way of mixing up the metas is to limit certain worlds in the wilderness to have a gear cap of either X amount of GP OR restrict certain items such as Crystal armour, ZCB etc. \n\nI think the way it could be implemented is that you cannot enter the wilderness if you have over X amount or any of those items as opposed to you cannot attack someone if you are breaking the restrictions, those would make it apply to PVMers also so they cannot anti PK in max gear etc on a low risk world.\n\nNot only would this mix up the metas and add diversity it could also act as a sort of ranking tier in a way as people who are very good would not really want to fight on a 200k risk world as the rewards just aren't good enough but for a new PKer learning it would be a fairer and lower risk fight.\n\nThoughts?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035emx\/make_certain_worlds_capped_gear_in_wilderness\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035emx\/make_certain_worlds_capped_gear_in_wilderness\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 09:48 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"[Suggestion] Superior Dwarf: A normal sized man","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035m4b\/suggestion_superior_dwarf_a_normal_sized_man\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/87to1pc8j1aa1.png","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 09:58 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Max Cape Speedrun - Logout Slayer - Ep 21","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035pev\/max_cape_speedrun_logout_slayer_ep_21\/","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bW4PG5fO2kM","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:01 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"How rare is Seercull drop from an office stapler?","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1035ssm\/how_rare_is_seercull_drop_from_an_office_stapler\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/dg7s86w723aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:05 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"I died in the boss fight of sins of our father can I get my stuff back?","content":"I just returned after a long stint of not playing and thought id get quest cape and I dc'd and died while on the boss fight","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10360h2\/i_died_in_the_boss_fight_of_sins_of_our_father\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/10360h2\/i_died_in_the_boss_fight_of_sins_of_our_father\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:14 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Dual account","content":"[removed]","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103639h\/dual_account\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103639h\/dual_account\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:17 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"toa entry mode carry","content":"I really need some help I cant raid worth shit.

Some thoughts\/suggestions.","content":"(To preface, when I say \"we\" did something, I usually mean the jmods did without backlash or with approval from the community)\n\nSecrets of the North requires the Curse of the Empty Lord miniquest, which requires players to visit either the lava maze (40-45 wild) or the rogues' castle (50-55 wild,) among other places. Previous to this, Chronozon for Family Crest and the Abyssal Mage for Enter the Abyss were the only wilderness content that gate the qpc and, by extension, the lumbridge elite diary. Curse of the Empty Lord is a miniquest and is not required for the QPC, but making it a prerequisite for a \"true\" quest, it will be.\n\nI agree with the lore reasons for wanting to include the prerequisite for the new quest. I *get* that the wilderness has lore implications and those should be available for use in design for new content. I'm not against any of that.\n\nHowever.\n\nI also think jmods should stop trying to force pvp into every avenue of the game. We just spent a year or more adding new items that have no quest requirements for the sole reason that it is unfair to \"force\" pvp'ers to go skilling and to go questing since that's an avenue of the game they don't like. If that is true, then we should not \"force\" pve and skilling players into pvp.\n\nRev caves and the chaos altar are pieces of content that I find badly designed (by being so overtuned to bring otherwise unwilling participants into pvp to act as content for other players, rather than by making the content itself interesting and interactive) but their existence doesn't actually force me as a player to interact with them to do other things, so I can tolerate it. Gilded altars, ectofuntus, ensouled heads, CG, and slayer exist. MA\/MA2 exist, but they're entirely optional, so missing the 2% magic damage and god spells is a choice I can make. No other content is impossible without them.\n\nWhat I *don't* want is that the wilderness is off the table for lore use; that would be super dumb to suggest. I do believe, though, that there should be some minor level of accommodation made for players who, like pvp'ers who don't want to quest, don't want to participate in pvp, whether that be because hardcore ironman and taking risks on their own terms (e.g. against programs) or just because they don't want to act as content for other players at their expense (for example, I refuse to play any direct pvp in games anymore because it's *really* bad for my mental health.)\n\nAs a possible solution, we could create one world where several things are simulateously true, to minimize disruption of the main game: pvp disabled, bosses don't spawn, and clue scrolls\/slayer tasks\/diaries cannot progress. Such a change would allow things like these quests to be completed without creating an avenue for abuse of mechanics that were previously dependent on pvp for balance (wilderness slayer, wilderness bosses and uniques, diaries, etc.) Some content would still exist but it is all of minor value - iron bar spawns, rogue chests, dark crabs, fountain of rune. This would be ideal, but it would be a huge amount of work. Granted, we already created a lot of items that parallel high-requirement armor just for pvp, so this seems fair. We also have several worlds that have special rulesets, so this isn't new territory either. High risk worlds disable protect item and force a skull. Pvp worlds enable pvp everywhere. Target worlds have their own entire minigame. Blast furnace worlds have dwarves operating the furnace.\n\nA second option is to kick the can down the road and add an alternative (always available) route for Curse of the Empty Lord that gates it instead behind several other hard achievements, for example, put one of the ghosts in the graveyard North of Prif. This is the best design moving forward IMO. If this miniquest were added today, it wouldn't be added to the wilderness.\n\nAnother option would be to move the qpc to a static qp count, similar to what we saw voted on when A Night at the Theatre was released. I disagreed with the argument put forth at the time (\"ANATT is too hard therefore don't require it\") but I *do* think it's worth considering moving the QPC to a static QP count, especially as we add more and more M\/GM quests. Moving goalposts are never good milestones. Currently there are 291 qp, so once we pass 300 total qp, that seems a fair number to fix the QPC (untrimmed) at. Then lock QPC(t) to all QP. Or just swap the diary requirement from QPC emote to \"talk to the old man with X qp\" which I like less, but would be easier to do.\n\n-------\n\n\"You chose to limit yourself.\"\n\nThis would be valid if we didn't already disregard that for pvp'ers who didn't want to skill or quest. Motivation for why a player doesn't want to do content is irrelevant for the above arguments.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1038oxv\/with_the_release_of_secrets_of_the_north_deep\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1038oxv\/with_the_release_of_secrets_of_the_north_deep\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 12:02 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Where are you from?","content":"Curios\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/1038sms)","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1038sms\/where_are_you_from\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1038sms\/where_are_you_from\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 12:06 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Be the winner of $750 paypal free registration now!!","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1038vqt\/be_the_winner_of_750_paypal_free_registration_now\/","url":"https:\/\/trianglerockers.com\/show.php?l=0&amp;u=50775&amp;id=49867&amp;tracking_id=","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 12:09 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"I have what you would call good \"Bad Luck\".

Stacking, spec etc. Which I'm slowly figuring out from vids and the runescape Wikipedia (I think stacking is when you deal multiple hits at the same time?) . It almost feels like a whole new game.

How do melee accounts fight mages? \n\nThank you!!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102v5z1\/noob_here_with_some_pvp_questions_f2p\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102v5z1\/noob_here_with_some_pvp_questions_f2p\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 12:33 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Rightfully banned.

I\u2019ve played on and off since the 4th grade, so over 15+ years like many of us.  The last time I was \u201caddicted\u201d was during trailblazer leagues and covid. I had left my job, moved back home to spend time with my family and save money, and was looking to move to a new city in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime, I was HOOKED, playing 8+ hours a day for about a month straight.  Then I started a new job, stopped playing completely and eventually moved across the country.\n\nNearly 2 years later, I\u2019m back.  I had a week off work last week, was bored out of my mind and decided to start up runelite.  At first I was bored and was about to log back off within minutes, but then decided to try out zulrah for the first time.  I failed miserably at first but looked at a few guides and was hooked again.  I played till 4am that night grinding zulrah.\n\nThe next day I was so confused.  How the fuck did I get addicted again so quickly?  I hadn\u2019t felt this kind of excitement in such a long time that I forgot what it was like.  Staying up all night, waking up super early.  It\u2019s similar to being a kid the night before christmas and the next morning.\n\nI realized what I had been missing was feeling anticipation, taking on a worthy challenge, having a clear progression of goals and working towards it, trying something new, learning and growing, flow, productivity (even if it is just an illusion since it\u2019s runescape after all, not real life).\n\nWhy haven\u2019t I felt this good in so long?  After some reflection it was clear I\u2019ve been bored at my job.  My company is great, I make good money and work remotely less than 40 hours a week.  This is a dream scenario for most people, which is what I told myself so I could stop feeling being so ungrateful.\n\nBut the truth is, it\u2019s ok to be honest with yourself and admit you\u2019re unhappy.  I haven\u2019t learned anything new in over 9 months, it\u2019s unclear how I contribute to the whole, I\u2019m by myself all day and I\u2019m not thrilled about our product.  It\u2019s ok for me to want something different and want more.  \u201cThe greatest risk in life is taking no risks\u201d - The Wise Oldman\n\nSo runescape seems to find me before major turning points in life.  It\u2019s a sign, maybe even a cry for help.  This is how I realized it\u2019s time for my next adventure in real life and it\u2019s time for a new job.  Yes, the grass isn\u2019t always greener but I am willing to take that risk instead of slowly burning out where I am.  In other words, yes I could keep grinding Zulrah and make good money and run on autopilot, but why not try out COX, TOB, Nex, TOA now that I have good enough stats and gear?  \n\nThis isn\u2019t to diss runescape, it\u2019s ok in moderation.  The point is to think about what feelings runescape gives you and how you can find those positive feelings in other areas of your life.  What is life trying to teach you?  What are you trying to escape from if you are playing runsecape too much?  What have I learned about myself during these 15+ years?  Where is life trying to guide you?  \n\nGod bless and praise Saradomin!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1039zn9\/osrs_life_lessons_an_unrequested_longwinded\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1039zn9\/osrs_life_lessons_an_unrequested_longwinded\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 12:52 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"}]

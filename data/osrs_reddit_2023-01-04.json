On any given island there can a number of pve encounters:\n\n1. World bosses (bosses that anyone can attack with anyone else on a world, like gwd bosses).\n2. Dungeons (bosses that can only be fought in an instance either solo, or in a team).\n\nYour regular gear, weapons and armour won't work on these islands. You'll need to help the communities there in order to be rewarded with new gear that can be used on the various islands.\n\n# LOOT MECHANICS \n\nLoot from these encounters will be dropped in a similar way to Nex. Each time you complete a pve encounter, the rewards you can receive include weapons, armour and resources. \n\nLoot is rolled per player, meaning that more than 1 person can receive the same unique and there can be multiple uniques dropped per kc. There will be a damage threshold that grants better odds than the base rate for uniques if you surpass it.\n\nAll weapons and armour items will be untradable to players other than the group you were with (and only for 1 hour to them). Materials, resources, etc will be tradable to others but will be important to collect.\n\n# Account progression\n\nEach time you complete a dungeon, you will have the option to scale up the encounter like an enrage mechanic where specific stats are modified to make the encounters more difficult. So think cox, then cox 2, then cox 3 and so on.\n\nEvery 5 levels you ascend, you will be introduced to new mechanics. Every 10 levels you scale, you will be rewarded with a new unique drop table that features upgrades to your weapons and armour as well as more resources that can be crafted or used to enhance your current weapons and armour to make them better for the next dungeon difficulty (just not as good as drops awarded to you). Clearing the encounters also awards sailing skill experience as does the crafting and enchanting of gear.\n\nThe weapons and armour you can upgrade are both hand weapon slots, gloves, amulets, head, chest, legs, boots, cape, and ring.\n\n# Tradable loot\n\nAt a raid scale of 20 (max scale) for an island, the new loot table you gain access to includes tradable rewards. These are able to buff your existing weapons and armour, granting them unique stats and effects. \n\nYou have to have an existing set of island specific weapon and armour to even buff them with these rewards and they only enhance that level. Meaning if you used the tradable rewards to buff your current gear that is only at a level 10 tier and replaced that gear with better items at level 15 or level 20, then you'd have to get more of those tradable rewards to buff the new gear set you have. Making them forever useful to yourself and other players that are interested in higher level pve encounters.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103lvwn\/how_the_new_skill_could_create_an_entirely_new\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103lvwn\/how_the_new_skill_could_create_an_entirely_new\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 08:41 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Guardians of the Rift Duo Strategy?","content":"Having a hard time finding sources on how to duo this minigame.

I caught a temp RWT ban because I grabbed 500m off a friend which I had loaned to him prior, I'm confident this is what I caught the ban for because it's the only substantial transfer of in-game wealth I've been apart of. Apparently you can't even loan gp to friends or just give\/receive large quantities of gp anymore without it being flagged as a ban. I even moved some of the money to a pure and my pure got the same temp ban as my main and according to my account status, some of my wealth was removed, so now I guess I'm going to have less of my hard-earned money than before. It's actually stupid, I'm max caped, a paid subscriber, and have over 400 days play time, does Jagex honestly believe I'm going to risk that by RWTing? If you can just take gp from any player for no reason other than because you felt like it, why even continue playing the game? Sorry for the rant post but this is just dumb. If we can't loan\/give\/receive gp from other players without risking RWT bans with WEALTH REMOVAL then why even have free trade at all? Just implement the trade limit again Jagex, I know you want to. I wouldn't even care about the temp ban alone, if I was only temp banned I wouldn't have even made this post, I'd just be way more careful with how I trade gp around, but removing my earned gp on top of a temp ban is what pisses me off. I'm sure everyone is going to comment \"yeah right you RWTed\" and that's your prerogative, you can choose to believe me or not, but I can promise I haven't paid or received real world money in exchange for in-game wealth in ANY way.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103nmfe\/jagex_back_at_it_again_with_the_false_rwt_bans\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103nmfe\/jagex_back_at_it_again_with_the_false_rwt_bans\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:00 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"You all seriously underestimate the power of having 37 Prayer.","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103nqxe\/you_all_seriously_underestimate_the_power_of\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/kpgada4sm6aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:05 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Finally getting the hang of Vorkath!","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103ntmc\/finally_getting_the_hang_of_vorkath\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/eqn1e4bu55aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:09 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Runelite isn't resizing on Arch Linux","content":"I installed the .appimage from the runelite website (not Aarchx64 the other one) and when I run it with wmname LG3D it does go larger, but I still cannot resize the window, why is this?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103ntiz\/runelite_isnt_resizing_on_arch_linux\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103ntiz\/runelite_isnt_resizing_on_arch_linux\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:09 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"West Coast server ping increase?","content":"All of a sudden every world has just gone up 50-60ping.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103o9s6\/west_coast_server_ping_increase\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103o9s6\/west_coast_server_ping_increase\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:30 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Nazis playing RuneScape","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103oasd\/nazis_playing_runescape\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/6t2l37qar6aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:31 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Saw a video on the cabbage cult, had to make something for it","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103odfb\/saw_a_video_on_the_cabbage_cult_had_to_make\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/3e123vsca5aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-04 10:35 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-04"},{"title":"Hey gamers, question for you.","content":"Hey everyone!\n\nHope y\u2019all are doing good.

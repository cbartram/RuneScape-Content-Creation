Counting to 15 seconds (14.4 seconds as per the wiki) + 3 seconds (delay before entangling again) is quite challenging\n\nI've read somewhere on this sub that it takes five to six attacks before the casted entangle ends. I couldn't find that comment or post anymore\n\nI'm still refining my PK skills. And this is one of the area that I want to improve upon on; knowing when the casted entangle ends with counting \n\nUsing the five to six attacks method works well with green dragon bots and pvmers who just runs away without fighting back. But the challenge comes is when I face pvmers who fights back or normal spellbook wildy pkers\n\nAny inputs would highly be appreciated.

I'm not sure if all of the below has to be right to be accepted but I am 100% sure of most of it except account creation date (i could be off by a month or two) and creation ISP(cant remember between 2 ISPs). I  could be remembering these 2 details wrong due to how long ago I created the account (won't specify year but its before 2010). I have provided full moving history of my life, creation country, most recent ISP and IP address, additional transaction IDs since account creation. The newest piece of information I have included is my IRL full name which is the payment name on the account for the entirety of its history so hoping this makes a big difference. Previous appeals included all the specific dates I changed payment methods, email changes, alt accounts but I am not sure if they look at each appeal by itself or use other appeals too.

Suprisingly I got message \"Incorrect password\". It was weird cause I logged in couple days ago. Tried again multiple times - same. Then it came a real - my account was hacked. I couldn't understand how is it possible, after almost 10 years. So I tried starting to recover account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow my account was stolen:\n\nI tried to login my e-mail which my account was regisetred with and used as logging in. There again I got message for invalid password. So I started recovering my e-mail account. But it was impossible and here's the reason. NOT USING REAL E-MAIL PROVIDER OR DOMAINS. I contacted e-mail provider about the issue. They responded my that they have let go of certain e-mail domains, which included my e-mail domain [\"@justexample.com](mailto:\"@justexample.com)\". Now someone had made new account with same e-mail name and domain on another new e-mail provider. And therefore gotten access to my OSRS account. So it takes just e-mail to get hacker your account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO THERE'S NO WAY I EVER HAVE ACCESS E-MAIL I HAD ACCOUNT REGISTRED WITH AND USED AS LOGIN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrying to get help from Jagex Support:\n\nSo I started making account recovery. I bet most of you know details jagex want in their account recovery when you don't access e-mail, if not link is here [https:\/\/secure.runescape.com\/m=accountappeal\/passwordrecovery](https:\/\/secure.runescape.com\/m=accountappeal\/passwordrecovery)\n\nand click I did not recieve e-mail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this automatic system with this lack information you can provide expects you to fill in all fillable boxes.

This would be a fun easter egg but also fit well into the game while making desert adventuring a tad more enjoyable\/fashionable.\n\nI wouldn't mind adding this scroll in as an untradeable drop to the ToA reward chest as well, available on all invocation levels.\n\nThis would be mildly helpful when mining in the desert (granite or shooting stars), doing clue scrolls, and running into ToA, and future desert content. It could conceivably also create an opportunity for players to socialize outside of the ToA pyramid without concern for the desert sun.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/106n951\/desert_treasure_2_or_new_toa_reward_idea_scroll\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/106n951\/desert_treasure_2_or_new_toa_reward_idea_scroll\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-08 11:26 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-08"},{"title":"Lol could anybody help me run a entry mode ToA?

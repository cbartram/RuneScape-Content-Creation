Whether they would ever do this is a mystery to all of us.\n\nBots are highly discouraged and in most cases this is because of the selfish gains of the bot owner. However, when a bot is ran solely for entertainment or unselfish reasons, the community hasn't had much of an issue. E.g., clan bots that communicate to clan members and\/or the TwitchPlaysOSRS bot. (although, that is technically not a real bot)... In the event a developer created a middle man bot solely non-profit (meaning there are no fees for the swap at hand), how would the community respond?\n\nE.g., two players PM an active bot that just sits at Lumbridge and does nothing. Prior to their messaging, Player 1 communicates to Player 2 that they want to swap 10m OSRS to 100m RS3 (rates are not actual). Player 2 agrees to the swap with a fee of 5M.\nPlayer 1 private messages our Bot \u201c!swap Player2Username 10M OSRS 105M RS3\u201d (obviously, this could be done vice versa)\n\nBot would respond with \u201cconfirming request.\u201d And message player 2: \u201cPlayer1Username would like to swap 105M of your RS3 GP in exchange for 10M of their OSRS GP. Respond with \u201c!confirm\u201d or \u201c!reject\u201d\u201d.\n\nUpon confirming, our Bot would trade Player 1 for the 10M OSRS GP. Once received, a parallel RS3 bot will trade Player 2 for the 105M GP. Once both have been accepted and both bots hold the money, then our Bot would give the money to their respective players. If at any point, either player tries to edit the trade, then a warning would be pushed against that player (who committed the offence). 3 strikes and they aren't allowed to swap with that middleman bot anymore and a warning would be sent to the other player of their offences. The bot would also keep track of all transactions in the event that A.) one of the players goes offline for some reason, or B.) the bot somehow gets knocked offline.\n\nWhat would the community think of this? I partially ask because I am finishing up a few of my own personal projects and am finding room for a new one. It's either I start working on some RuneLite plugin or I find a niche use case for the community in a helpful manner. (no promises, however)\n\nTL;DR\nWould a bot for non-personal gain that solely assists players in not getting scammed be a good or bad look?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102khu9\/swapping_middleman_bot\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102khu9\/swapping_middleman_bot\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 04:46 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"New Skill Idea: Animal Training\/ Taiming","content":" \n\nWhat do all Runescape players have in common?  THE LOVE OF PETS!\n\nPets in Runescape are a mark of accomplishment. They are an amazing achievement that players grind for countless hours; but let's be honest, They do absolutely nothing. It is for this reason I would like to introduce Animal Training. With this new skill, players will raise various different types of animals that provide a plethora of benefits to all players.  \n\nI know what you're thinking. How is this different from summoning? To be honest, pet benefits will be similar. The difference is how you obtain these benefits. You will not grind monsters you do not want to fight for shards you do not want to obtain.  With this skill, you would raise the animals that you are wanting to use. You will name them, feed them, and train them to do what is needed. You will create a bond with these animals, and they will truly become part of you in game experience. \n\nHow to train the skill: \n\nTraining the skill will be done in 3 stages.\n\nFinding your companion: \n\nJagex already said they wanted to bring dogs in the game, so this would be a perfect opportunity to start. Players can start by obtaining a new puppy to train. After this, In true Runescape, you will have to grind to find  your companion. This can be done by various methods. You can milk a cow to find a runt, Find a baby rat while hunting with your pet cat, or Travel down river with a canoe to find an otter, to list a few examples. The rarity and ability to raise said companions is dependent on your level. The higher level you are, the more likely you are to find new and exciting companions to train. \n\nRaising your companion:\n\nThis is where the bulk of the skill would be based. Once you obtain a pet, you need to raise them. Just like a newborn puppy, there is not a whole lot they can do. You will need to take your companions to experience the world, and train it to know what it is supposed to do. An example of this would be a pet pig that you teach out to hunt for truffles, a new resource  item that could play a part in herblore or cooking. The limits to what we could have our new companions do is limitless, and could bring life to parts of the game that are not as visited by the players. \n\nWorking with your companions\n\nThis portion of the skill is where you reap the benefits of your hard work. You will bring your companion with you to any activity in the game to help you with your activities. Whenever you perform a task, your pet has the chance to help you; producing extra resources, dealing extra damage, ect. Whenever your pet successfully helps you, you will gain XP.This will be a nice passive way to train the skill, however at higher levels you will unlock new pets that provide better max bonuses, thus repeating the cycle. There will also be exclusive activities to work directly with your companions, to gain active XP, such as truffle hunting with the pig. \n\nThings to consider \n\nDo not worry. I did not forget about existing pets. The current way to hunt for these pets will be the same. What I would recommend for these pets, is that if you train them, you will get the maximum xp boost for that skill, since these pets are so rare.  Boss pets can be used to for combat, or other things we can consider in the future. \n\nThe benefits are a lot like summoning, and I get that. I thought the summoning skill brought a lot of value to the game. This is OSRS's chance to bring similar benefits in a much more exciting way. \n\nIf you die with your pet, they will have the same effect as pets do now, except there is no insurance for these skill specific pets and you will have to find and raise a new one. Current pets will be included in this so be sure to be careful with them. \n\nOverall, this skill could add a lot of flavor into the game, and I think it would be really cool to see implemented. Please let me know what you think.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1023vxm\/new_skill_idea_animal_training_taiming\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1023vxm\/new_skill_idea_animal_training_taiming\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 04:48 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Give Me Advice on POH, Please! | RMSS #5","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102kjui\/give_me_advice_on_poh_please_rmss_5\/","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aNYZQLX7m7A","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 04:48 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"premium account?","content":"I would like to play this game with my boyfriend.\n\n  I haven't tried it yet, but he does (in childhood).

I love OSRS and I want to create something similar, except it's first-person single-player. \n\nMy first thoughts:\n\n\\-Single-player means there's no concept of GE, which makes me want to rethink monster drops. For example, in OSRS instead of grinding for a DHCB, you would normally just grind Vorkath or some other money maker and buy it from GE. In a single-player game, that's not possible. I still want to keep the concept of certain bosses dropping unique items or item sets like Barrows, etc. I love the concept of grinding for an item, and when I get it, certain parts of the game become much easier with that item. \n\n\\-I want to keep the ability for a character to be whatever they want to be. In OSRS, you can be a ranger and easily switch to melee\/mage without having to dedicate yourself to one skill. I love that about OSRS and it's one of the things other MMO's fail at.\n\n\\-Being a first-person game, I can't just go for the \"click on an enemy to fight\" style of combat. There has to be some kind of abilities involved (like RS3). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would appreciate any input. What kind of stuff do you think fits\/doesn't fit in a single-player first person game heavily inspired by OSRS?\n\nI'm also aware of the legal implications of \"copying\", but being inspired by another game isn't illegal.

For example a dragon warhammer is around 100m in the UGIM market and zenyte jewellery around 50m each and so on it goes.\n\nSince this unregulated territory and Jagex have nothing inbuilt to deal with trades of this nature (including name trading), then there's definitely things to be careful of about doing these kind of trades and if it's too complicated, then go through the regular de-iron process. To prevent getting scammed when doing what is essentially trust trades:\n\n1. Tell the buyer they have to go first.\n2. If they communicate through discord, look up how to view someone's unique discord ID (developer tools setting on disc) and compare it.\n3. Have another set of eyes on the deal and the process. Sometimes when you've been scammed, you only realise just after hitting accept on the trade window. Having some friends overlooking the deal can lower the probability of being scammed simply because there's another set of eyes looking over the trade process.\n4.

Then the drag of actually going there and pick up what you need\u2026   \nEnough is enough! Time to ask the Bank of Gielinor to suggest a teleporting service! \n#Location \nStart of quest will be in a new location, the BOG (Bank of Gielinor) Headquarters.    \nMy suggestion would be to locate this somewhere in Varrock in one of the unused areas.    \nThis would house several offices and a big R&amp;D area. \n\nQuest would start by talking to an NPC in the R&amp;D department or at the reception. (a fan or a friend \/ family of an earlier quest quest NPC?) \n#Prerequisites\nHonestly, no clue, but there should be some prerequisite quests or a required number of questpoints needed to start it.    \nThis to explain how you can enter the building to make your suggestion. \n\nSame for level requirements, there should be some, probably in Construction, Crafting and Magic, but not certain which or what level. \n#Quest\nFirst you go to the headquarters and talk to the reciptionist and mention you have an idea you would like to suggest.    \n\nIf you haven't done the prerequisite quests, they would say they'll pass along the idea, but nothing would happen. \n\nIf you did the quests or have enough quest points, she\/he would say they have heard of you (from stories in bars or they know someone you helped\u2026 anyway, they're a fan) and suggests to tell your idea directly to the person at R&amp;D. \n\nThe person at R&amp;D totally loves your idea, but is swamped with work and asks if you could help him out to make a prototype to present to the director of the firm. \n\nWhat follows is a back and forward of the scientist asking for specific materials or sending you on an errand to request advice from specialists (construction NPCs, wizards\u2026 Maybe some from previous quests). \n\nAfter finishing a working prototype and testing it successfully\u2026 a failed test may or may not include defeating some creatures of the Abyss (which prompted the scientist to find help from an expert in teleportation)... He then asks you to join him to present the prototype to the director. \n\nYou convince director and says he will look into selling the device and to roll out the service.    \nHe also allows you to already use the service and the device as long you provide feedback and allows you to buy the device at manufacturing price if you bring the materials. \n\nThis would complete the quest. \n#Reward\nThis is the whole reason I invented this quest to begin with, as the reward is a nice quality of life upgrade, but feels too powerful to just get it for free. \n\nAfter finishing the quest, you bring the materials and some money to the R&amp;D person to create one of those prototypes.\n\nThis you can then use to upgrade your closet, caperack, treasure chest\u2026 In your POH.\nEvery single thing you upgrade like this can then be accessed from any bank in the game. (one prototype is needed for each thing you upgrade)\n\nUpgradeable things:    \n - Everything in the Costume Room    \n - STASH units (device would not be cheap, so that you might only do some key STASHes)    \n - Maybe the Seed Vault after completing a follow-up miniquest?    \n - Maybe give one to Elnock Inquisitor in Puro-Puro?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102dcb6\/poh_bank_connection_quest\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102dcb6\/poh_bank_connection_quest\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:07 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"When you smoke too much Ranarr \u262f\ufe0f","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102den8\/when_you_smoke_too_much_ranarr\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/5lpg4bikjw9a1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:10 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Cmon Jagex for real","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102dgbj\/cmon_jagex_for_real\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/64gd4kyvjw9a1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:11 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"announcement.This is a public service anouncement.","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/101z1c7\/announcementthis_is_a_public_service_anouncement\/","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/esnl4lkfir9a1","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:15 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Skill Proposal - Musicianship","content":"[removed]","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/101z1h9\/skill_proposal_musicianship\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/101z1h9\/skill_proposal_musicianship\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:15 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Why won\u2019t he look at me during? \ud83e\udd7a","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/101z26x\/why_wont_he_look_at_me_during\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/z0fxlvfa0t9a1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:16 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"GP Drop Bug @ Vorkath Dropped the 129k but somehow there was a 65k stack that was bugged","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/101z3ps\/gp_drop_bug_vorkath_dropped_the_129k_but_somehow\/","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/evpgdmftir9a1","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:18 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Can you force random events?","content":"I am currently bringing a torstol *everywhere* to get the 10 stamina potions needed to construct a revitalisation pool in my HCIM POH.

Some of the only info we have so far is that Jagex don't want it to be a straight upgrade, but rather something you situationally use instead of the current prayer book. How can they do this? What prayers would they have? What would you like to see?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I'd like to see an over-head prayer which rivals the protection prayers in PvP. Something that brings back hybrid\/tribrid without needing an 8 action per tick switch to compete. Soul-split style healing was the answer pre-eoc. We could have an overhead which made your attacks typeless for example, so they hit through protection prayers - or something which buffs offensive damage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I imagine the new prayer book will have to have melee\/mage\/range protect, although I'd kind of like it not to. This is because so many monsters have attacks like cereberus, wardens, olm - which require you to flick on a specific prayer. Could these new protection prayers have 0% pvp damage reduction as a reason to use the main prayer book? Or not include the protect item prayer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) I'd like to see the prayers on this book not be 1-tick-flickable. Soulsplit allowed you to have no food\/prayer pots with unlimited healing with minimal effort. I do however dislike what you can do on the normal prayer book with 1-tick flicking. This book to not offer that, will it need to be stronger when you don't 1-tick it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) Prayer animations on the curses book were really awesome. Turning on turmoil, beserker, and soulsplit spell style animations were really cool. I'd love to see animations on prayers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) The book will be quite high level, as it's requiring DT 2 which has in itself, 4 difficult bosses and is a grandmaster quest. So no need to add low tier prayers for example; 5% attack increase, 10% attack increase - unless they stack with everything else. I'd like to see more novel ideas such as; shortbows ignore your opponents defence 10% of the time - or while using this prayer special attacks cost 5% less energy to use - or upon killing a monster all drops are low-alched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) What will be the drawbacks for using this book? Will it have things like debuffs, for example, a piety equivalent could mean you take 10% more magic and ranged damage. Will it cost you more to use? will it not offer you any damage boosting prayers, but massive utility - like soulsplit, or stronger deflect prayers.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102dmbh\/new_prayer_book_discussion\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102dmbh\/new_prayer_book_discussion\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:18 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Been doing some 3D printing recently","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102dsf3\/been_doing_some_3d_printing_recently\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/102dsf3","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:25 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Hot Take: 92 kinda isn't half-way.","content":"People need to hear this. \n\nI see people get discouraged when they hit 92 in a skill and think that they're only half-way there.

However, OSRS combat has flaws, and I think it could be better. I want to float some braindead ideas for how it could be changed, in the hope that someone smarter than me is sufficiently horrified by them to get the juices flowing on some actually good ideas. Off we go!\n\n# What is Old School combat?\n\nNot quite turn-based and not quite real-time... I find it helpful to think of it as an *action points* system, where each point is a game cycle (tick). An Abyssal Whip attack costs 4 action points, as the weapon attacks every 4 ticks. Eating most food costs 3 points, except for combo foods like Karambwans, which cost 2. Potions are free (they don't delay your next attack), but they have a 3 tick cooldown. And so on. This pseudo-turn-based, action-economy combat system naturally generates the mechanics that we see in high-level PvM and PvP.\n\n## Gear &amp; Prayer Switching\n\nIn our action point economy, gear and prayer switching is free. Obviously, this makes it incredibly strong, and a requirement for optimal gameplay. If you intend to make a ranged attack on your next action, there is no downside to equipping all of the `+ranged_attack` gear in your inventory and enabling a `+ranged_attack` prayer. Similarly, if you expect your opponent to make a ranged attack, you should enable Protect from Missiles and switch to `+ranged_defense` gear. There are three constraints on switching:\n* Prayer Points. You need to have them to turn on the prayer you want. This is a fine mechanic--not terribly exciting, just another number to keep track of.\n* Inventory Space. Every gear switch you bring is a lost consumable. This one is great, and fundamental to RS combat.\n* How fast you can click before getting a repetitive strain injury. I don't find this mechanic fun at all. **Suggestion: allow us to define loadouts, which consist of gear and prayers. Add clickable UI elements for each loadout that switches all of your gear and prayers in one click.** Bonus: no more worrying about AHK, because now everyone has it.\n\nOther possible changes that are fun to think about:\n* Impose an action point cost on equipping gear or enabling prayers. 1 tick to equip a weapon. 2 ticks to enable a protection prayer. You get the idea--balance it how you like.\n* Make protection prayers exclusive. If you enable Protect from Missiles, every other prayer gets disabled.\n* Change the game cycle rate. Currently, a tick is 0.6 seconds. If it were 1.2, you would only need to click half as fast to switch gear and prayers in time for your next attack. This would require **a lot** of balancing changes, or we could pretend everything scales linearly and simply double all the numbers in the game--I'm good either way. Bonus: the game servers get twice as much time to process an event loop! Think of the hardware savings!\n\n## Movement\n\nLike switching, movement costs no action points. If you intend to eat at Kalphite Queen, there is no downside to moving under her. If you freeze your opponent in PvP and want to eat, there is no downside to moving under them (I actually have no idea, Wilderness scaryyy). When you move to dodge the Warden P3 ground slam attack, your DPS is unchanged. Again, we have some constraints:\n* Run Energy. Much like Prayer Points, it's a number that goes down. Some enemies make it go down faster, and some consumables make it go down slower, or even go up (spoil me!). Not the pinnacle of game design, but pretty inoffensive.\n* Freezes. In general, games taking control away from the player is Not Fun^TM but OSRS doesn't really overdo it. Another fine mechanic.\n* How fast you can click before getting a repetitive strain injury. I'm sensing a pattern. This isn't as bad as gear and prayer switching, but you do have to move your mouse to the target tile and then back on your opponent to attack, and you're doing this *on top* of your switches. **Suggestion: allow players to stay in combat while moving, so you don't have to click on your opponent again after the move command.** I don't know exactly how this would interact with multi-combat, auto-retaliate, attack range, etc. but I bet the big brains at Jagex have some ideas knocking around. You could also give gear switches the same treatment.\n\nOther ideas:\n* Movement costs action points. This actually sounds horrible, please don't do this.\n* Walking (1 tile\/tick) and running (2 tiles\/tick) remain free, but introduce an even faster *sprinting* (3 tiles\/tick) movement state, which does cost action points, meaning it delays your next attack\/food.\n* Switching armor imposes a cooldown on movement. Go ahead and switch those boots, but you'll be frozen for 1 game tick.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe combat meta revolves around *free actions* that you can perform without delaying your next attack. Because they're free, you can perform any number of them in one tick, which means that a major component of PvM and PvP skill is the maximum number of buttons you can click in 0.6 seconds. I would be interested to explore ideas on how to keep the pseudo-turn-based, dice-rolling, action-economy combat system in place while reducing the amount of clicking and mouse movement, and increasing the strategic calculations you need to make. \n\nThe people who play this game are getting older, and while I had a lot of fun tweaking out with Meepo and Invoker in Dota 2 when I was 16, those days are behind me. I would like to click less.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102eeig\/the_osrs_combat_system_how_does_it_work_and_could\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102eeig\/the_osrs_combat_system_how_does_it_work_and_could\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:49 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"},{"title":"Is 45-70 farming in one day possible?","content":"Just trying to figure out the quickest way to do this.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102eesv\/is_4570_farming_in_one_day_possible\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/102eesv\/is_4570_farming_in_one_day_possible\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-03 12:50 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-03"}]

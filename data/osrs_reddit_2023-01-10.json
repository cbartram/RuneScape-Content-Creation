I Have had this Idea  for a few years since they first introduced the idea of sailing. I have also been a long-time fan of the  Dungeoneering skill in RS3 thinking it was great to have a skill that had every other skill needed to be  successful. The Name of the skill would be called Exploration. \n\n I think the greatest part in OSRS is being able to explore the game when you first start.  Unfortunately, with how long the game has been out and most of the player base being the same  people that played the game back when it was first released in the early 2000s pretty much every nook  and cranny of this beloved game has been explored. My skill idea of Exploration would revitalize  exploring OSRS in a way that has never been done before. This skill would be a combination of  Dungeoneering and Sailing. \n\n OSRS has vast oceans which could be easily filled with islands. These islands would have special  mobs and resource spawns and even quests. However, to reach these you would be skilled enough in  exploration to reach them. To level this skill, you would have to participate in explorations. There would  be 2 initial types of expeditions that you could join that would be placed at all the ports in the game.  Easy explorations starting at Port Serim up to Master that would leave from Relleka. These two types of  expeditions would be profitable explorations and patron explorations. Profitable would be like hunting  down bounties on bandits that have escaped to an offshore island and need to be hunted down or hunt  down strong beasts that attacked a village. Profitable explorations would be less experience per hour  while the patron ones would be more experience per hour.  \n\nThe main game play loop for this skill would be that you would set sail on an expedition to a  randomly generated island. Every island would have a different goal that would be needs to be  completed. These can range from a massive variety and would always have room to add more. Some  would be bounty hunts, monster hunts including land monsters and sea monsters, retrieving holy relics for various religious groups, defending villages in a pest control style of wave defense. And endless other  ideas.  You and your group of up to six individuals would look at the expedition board and then board a  ship after picking one. As you may know the sea is a very dangerous place, far too dangerous to bring  person possessions with you as they be lost on the high seas. This is where the dungeneering aspect  mixes into the skill. Your ship, based on how much you have upgraded it with resources and your  expedition skill level, would hold all the basic tool you would need. Hammer, saw, chisel, pickaxe, axe, and the other tools. Starting off with all bronze and be able to upgrade up to dragon. The ship could be  upgraded in many ways. Increase haul integrity, storage space, and even on deck ballista to aid you in  hunting sea monsters and protecting villages.  \n\nYou would start off gathering materials on the island to make weapons and armor. And fish or  hunt small to large creatures for food. During the gathering process you would be exploring the island  and looking for whatever the objective of the expedition would be. Due to the nature of the randomly  generated island, you could have small islands with vast caverns that you must work your way through  or sprawling plains, mountains and forests. There would be a vast number of creatures that would fill  these biomes. In these environments there would be obstacles that you would need all your skills to  transvers. Agility to jump gaps or squeeze through cervices, strength to move boulders, magic to break  seals, rune crafting to energize mystic locks, thieving to bypass traps, and so on. The versatility of this  skill is what would make it stick out. You can train every skill in RuneScape in this manner. Although it  would be much slower than training them the traditional ways. The main reward from completing expeditions would be experience in the Exploration skill. You  would also receive money for the bounty type of explorations. However, you would also receive a third reward. Exploration points. \n\nThese points would be spent on upgrading your ship and upgrade your  equipment.. Exploration points would also be used on cosmetic upgrades for tools, armors, and weapons to show off  how much of the world you have uncovered. From bronze to dragon would have (ex) attached to it with its own unique look. \n\nThe biggest thing you can also spend your points on would be a huge change in OSRS. This is quite controversial, but I feel this would be a good opportunity to bring in the tool belt. You  would upgrade your tool belt after unlocking it from basic up to master. These would not be easy to  achieve upgrades and the skill would be very slow to level, on par with runecrafting and would require all the other skills in the game to be successful. This would be one of the most rewarding.  I would love to hear some feed on what you think about this idea. I have spent a lot of time  thinking this up and if you think it is a good idea, I would love you to share it with your friends and  spread the idea around and maybe even get it to be added to the game.  Thank you so much for your time!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108gyup\/new_skill_exploration\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108gyup\/new_skill_exploration\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 01:27 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"New Skill Proposal: Inscription (Audio Narration and TL;DR in comments.)","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108gz26\/new_skill_proposal_inscription_audio_narration\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/108gz26","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 01:27 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Runescape tinder...

It became the heart of Englands trade as it created more wealth and employment then any other industry at its time. One out of seven people were employed in the trade and over a quarter of all households were helping in production.\n\nAnother great example is Arte Di Calimala, the guild of cloth finishers. Part of the guilds of Florence which controlled arts and trades between the 12-16th century. This was huge for them. They had iron rods around the town for keeping standards for tools between members. Armed protection for their shops and trading centres paid out of pocket.\n\nHow does this play a part in our game as a new skill? Well I see it as a way to create a new space, where we trade the raw materials needed for the skill. The skill will produce new materials not seen in-game also ONLY to be traded within the guild. Creating some type of off g\/e way of trading. Even if it\u2019s just the physical space would be ideal to making the system work.\n\nThe raw materials are then worked into items providing unique bonuses and making the improved version untradeable. 200 monsters\/3min prayer regen, 2+ str bonus for 2mins every 15mins of combat.\n\nMaybe having a materiel board that changes twice daily offering items important for the skill by offering in bulk. Say 1m logs = intricate material you would need for a chestplate. \n\nMaterials needed should also be able to be changed manually to foster and provoke people to try out new areas and old content.  Good use of boss heads here I\u2019m sure of it.\n\n\nSo what are the main take-always? \n\nIt\u2019s an independent skill which relies on items already in-game giving them another way to be sold to others and worked into useful items. \n\nIt\u2019s a great gold and item sink that provides players with a fun way to use and look at new items.\n\nMy vision is people would try to hold onto stupid and useless items like potato seeds and bronze armour to see if the guild members would offer a more compelling price. And if it didn\u2019t the guilds inter-city system would provide me a way to still obtain obscure items for use within the skill just through other means.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, I have been thinking about this a lot a work. And honestly man\u2019s needs a break. I wasn\u2019t going to post because I\u2019m too old for this game and my thoughts are grimy but I love the game too much and I know how much ya\u2019ll work off creativity.

ToA has such a huge scaling difficulty basically everyone can get through it and kill the final boss.\n\nBut there is something missing with this, players might not have experienced ToB, but they will have seen people doing it, on youtube, twitch etc. And they will see people talking about it.

This could be done with specific skills in mind.\n\nI haven't decided on what the best way to create these music sheets would be. \n\nOne idea I had was writing it on papyrus, then enchanting it using magic or something like that. That way it could scale with magic level.\n\nAnother way could be to have some sort of item requirement that gets consumed when creating the music sheet (i.e. energy potion for a low level run drain rate reduction song). I'm personally leaning towards this one.\n\nThe music sheets would be tradable. That way it creates incentive for people to make them as it could make them some gp and the players who can't be bothered can just buy the sheet music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne other thought I had that could be an issue is getting the duration of the buffs correct. Too long and it will be too powerful and too short would be useless. I think the best way would be to have them differ from different sheets of music. Higher leveled music could either have a longer duration or a more powerful buff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would need to be restrictions on how many buffs can be added at once otherwise it would be too overpowered. My thoughts were to have a maximum of 1 active buff for group and 1 for solo instruments. (Although this would need a lot more thought)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of this, there could be a music hall added somewhere in the game where you can use the instruments you've unlocked to create your own music.\n\nThe songs could then be submitted to a local playlist and all players inside the music hall could hear it. It won't grant xp but it could make a bit of a song creating community.\n\nYou could also have the option to play these at the Falador party room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much my idea at its current stage.

Eating directly after your character begins to run, not when he is arriving at the tile you clicked.\n\nAlways count to 4 for Hunlef attacks and switch after the 4th projectile appears. The attack damage seems to be calculated the first frame of Hunlef\u2019s attack animation, so if you switch during the animation, but before the projectile appears, you will still take damage.\n\nLearn tornado dodge timing (running through tornados). In the last phase it is often necessary to run through a tornado to path off the floor in time.\n\nLeave the prayer screen open by default. Switch back to prayer screen as soon as eating\/weapon switch is done.\n\n***Practice using peripheral vision to track hunlef\u2019s attack switches and character pathing. Eyes should rest somewhere between the character and Hunlef. During the final phase, many things happen at once. Being able to intake information using peripheral vision helps not miss prayer switches while dodging tornados, especially if you forget the attack count.\n\nThere\u2019s my $0.02. I hope it helps, and if you think I should change anything to improve, let me know!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108bzw4\/newbies_thoughts_after_1st_corrupted_gauntlet_kc\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108bzw4\/newbies_thoughts_after_1st_corrupted_gauntlet_kc\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 10:05 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Finally committed to first demonics trip n it paid off","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108c3au\/finally_committed_to_first_demonics_trip_n_it\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/mij9kffgw9ba1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 10:09 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Most toxic game by far go pvm in Wildy and see what I mean","content":"This game is full of toxic trolls that can\u2019t pk they should just take it out of the game","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108c7bq\/most_toxic_game_by_far_go_pvm_in_wildy_and_see\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108c7bq\/most_toxic_game_by_far_go_pvm_in_wildy_and_see\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 10:14 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Account Recovery Opt-Out","content":"Let me opt-out of Account Recovery on my account and only be able to recover\/reset if I maintain access to the original email.\n\nIf you share your information after opting out and you get locked out from that person changing your login information, that's 100% on you.

I make an account, really enjoy it for a while and then abandon it. This is often at the 2000-2100 total mark. I was kind of curious how you guys are dealing with this. \n\nWhen OSRS released i had a bunch of goals. The thing that really motivated me was that these goals were reachable. I knew that i could do end-game PvM eventually. When GWD was released i also knew that if i grinded it, i could obtain the drops. Even if i went dry, it was all in reach. I really enjoyed OSRS. \n\nNow, almost 10 years later, i am just demotivated. I have 3 accounts. A main, an iron, a Hardcore iron. Each of these accounts is over 2k total with the highest being just over 2100. I sometimes AFK the iron while i work but that's about it. \n\nThe reason for this demotivation is that the game became centered around \"full-time players\". OSRS isn't a game anymore, it's a job. If you don't put in at least 60-80 hours a week you are never ever going to \"complete\" this game. I'm not even talking about maxing but about PvM. \n\nThey put in grinds like the Wyvern Sigil, Dragon Warhammer, Basilisk Jaw which were rare enough but still manageable i suppose. Then we got stuff like the Corp sigils, Nightmare, Raids. It just got so insanely rare to receive a drop in your name it demotivated me hard. As a reference a bowfa alone takes about 80-100 hours if you go on drop rate. That's an insane amount of time for just 1 item in a video game. \n\nI put in the work. My Iron even has some raids items, the Dragon Warhammer, Jaw and more. I just got so demotivated knowing i will never be able to get this account to where i want it to be. Everything just got way too rare. I don't have this amount of time. Even if i did, the drops are so rare it's just not fun anymore. Completing the Nightmare, Nex or any Raid is literal torture. \n\nAlso to add: I'm not saying items should not be rare. I just feel like we went from rare to absolutely mental and i have no idea why. \n\nDoes anyone else share this feeling? How do you deal with it?

They probably got like 50xp for the whole 2 hours I was there.\n\nYou're welcome","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108fecv\/i_spent_2_hours_last_night_making_sure_a_bot_got\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108fecv\/i_spent_2_hours_last_night_making_sure_a_bot_got\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 12:24 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"why do you all continue to play a game with the most glaring of security flaws?","content":"seems like if you sneeze you get your account stolen and botted and all of your bank gets jacked. why even invest so much time into something if at any point some random can get into your account and steal your shit?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108ffjk\/why_do_you_all_continue_to_play_a_game_with_the\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108ffjk\/why_do_you_all_continue_to_play_a_game_with_the\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 12:26 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"new boss confirmed to be weak to crush?","content":"a lot of members in solitary and vintage seem to be noting it was confirmed, any1 else have similar information?","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1081n05\/new_boss_confirmed_to_be_weak_to_crush\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/1081n05\/new_boss_confirmed_to_be_weak_to_crush\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 12:28 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Thank god Spria finally taught me how to do slayer..","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108fl9g\/thank_god_spria_finally_taught_me_how_to_do_slayer\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/108fl9g","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 12:32 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"quick test (this'll be deleted in a second)","content":"TEST -

I Have had this Idea  for a few years since they first introduced the idea of sailing. I have also been a long-time fan of the  Dungeoneering skill in RS3 thinking it was great to have a skill that had every other skill needed to be  successful. The Name of the skill would be called Exploration. \n\n I think the greatest part in OSRS is being able to explore the game when you first start.  Unfortunately, with how long the game has been out and most of the player base being the same  people that played the game back when it was first released in the early 2000s pretty much every nook  and cranny of this beloved game has been explored. My skill idea of Exploration would revitalize  exploring OSRS in a way that has never been done before. This skill would be a combination of  Dungeoneering and Sailing. \n\n OSRS has vast oceans which could be easily filled with islands. These islands would have special  mobs and resource spawns and even quests. However, to reach these you would be skilled enough in  exploration to reach them. To level this skill, you would have to participate in explorations. There would  be 2 initial types of expeditions that you could join that would be placed at all the ports in the game.  Easy explorations starting at Port Serim up to Master that would leave from Relleka. These two types of  expeditions would be profitable explorations and patron explorations. Profitable would be like hunting  down bounties on bandits that have escaped to an offshore island and need to be hunted down or hunt  down strong beasts that attacked a village. Profitable explorations would be less experience per hour  while the patron ones would be more experience per hour.  \n\nThe main game play loop for this skill would be that you would set sail on an expedition to a  randomly generated island. Every island would have a different goal that would be needs to be  completed. These can range from a massive variety and would always have room to add more. Some  would be bounty hunts, monster hunts including land monsters and sea monsters, retrieving holy relics for various religious groups, defending villages in a pest control style of wave defense. And endless other  ideas.  You and your group of up to six individuals would look at the expedition board and then board a  ship after picking one. As you may know the sea is a very dangerous place, far too dangerous to bring  person possessions with you as they be lost on the high seas. This is where the dungeneering aspect  mixes into the skill. Your ship, based on how much you have upgraded it with resources and your  expedition skill level, would hold all the basic tool you would need. Hammer, saw, chisel, pickaxe, axe, and the other tools. Starting off with all bronze and be able to upgrade up to dragon. The ship could be  upgraded in many ways. Increase haul integrity, storage space, and even on deck ballista to aid you in  hunting sea monsters and protecting villages.  \n\nYou would start off gathering materials on the island to make weapons and armor. And fish or  hunt small to large creatures for food. During the gathering process you would be exploring the island  and looking for whatever the objective of the expedition would be. Due to the nature of the randomly  generated island, you could have small islands with vast caverns that you must work your way through  or sprawling plains, mountains and forests. There would be a vast number of creatures that would fill  these biomes. In these environments there would be obstacles that you would need all your skills to  transvers. Agility to jump gaps or squeeze through cervices, strength to move boulders, magic to break  seals, rune crafting to energize mystic locks, thieving to bypass traps, and so on. The versatility of this  skill is what would make it stick out. You can train every skill in RuneScape in this manner. Although it  would be much slower than training them the traditional ways. The main reward from completing expeditions would be experience in the Exploration skill. You  would also receive money for the bounty type of explorations. However, you would also receive a third reward. Exploration points. \n\nThese points would be spent on upgrading your ship and upgrade your  equipment.. Exploration points would also be used on cosmetic upgrades for tools, armors, and weapons to show off  how much of the world you have uncovered. From bronze to dragon would have (ex) attached to it with its own unique look. \n\nThe biggest thing you can also spend your points on would be a huge change in OSRS. This is quite controversial, but I feel this would be a good opportunity to bring in the tool belt. You  would upgrade your tool belt after unlocking it from basic up to master. These would not be easy to  achieve upgrades and the skill would be very slow to level, on par with runecrafting and would require all the other skills in the game to be successful. This would be one of the most rewarding.  I would love to hear some feed on what you think about this idea. I have spent a lot of time  thinking this up and if you think it is a good idea, I would love you to share it with your friends and  spread the idea around and maybe even get it to be added to the game.  Thank you so much for your time!","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108gyup\/new_skill_exploration\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108gyup\/new_skill_exploration\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 01:27 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Runescape tinder...

Then do the badges and have the selected choice of account for the badge. All this would do is show a badge and strike through the quests\/activities on menu list that would give defense, prayer, and\/or HP, etc. experience for that specific account build choice. This doesn\u2019t effect anything with the game, only makes sure to show what the account should stay away from and not have the account accidentally complete a quest that would give them that experience they do not want. These things could also be toggled.\n\n- I mean that\u2019s pretty much it. It really is simple to not break the game and do what they wanted.

It became the heart of Englands trade as it created more wealth and employment then any other industry at its time. One out of seven people were employed in the trade and over a quarter of all households were helping in production.\n\nAnother great example is Arte Di Calimala, the guild of cloth finishers. Part of the guilds of Florence which controlled arts and trades between the 12-16th century. This was huge for them. They had iron rods around the town for keeping standards for tools between members. Armed protection for their shops and trading centres paid out of pocket.\n\nHow does this play a part in our game as a new skill? Well I see it as a way to create a new space, where we trade the raw materials needed for the skill. The skill will produce new materials not seen in-game also ONLY to be traded within the guild. Creating some type of off g\/e way of trading. Even if it\u2019s just the physical space would be ideal to making the system work.\n\nThe raw materials are then worked into items providing unique bonuses and making the improved version untradeable. 200 monsters\/3min prayer regen, 2+ str bonus for 2mins every 15mins of combat.\n\nMaybe having a materiel board that changes twice daily offering items important for the skill by offering in bulk. Say 1m logs = intricate material you would need for a chestplate. \n\nMaterials needed should also be able to be changed manually to foster and provoke people to try out new areas and old content.  Good use of boss heads here I\u2019m sure of it.\n\n\nSo what are the main take-always? \n\nIt\u2019s an independent skill which relies on items already in-game giving them another way to be sold to others and worked into useful items. \n\nIt\u2019s a great gold and item sink that provides players with a fun way to use and look at new items.\n\nMy vision is people would try to hold onto stupid and useless items like potato seeds and bronze armour to see if the guild members would offer a more compelling price. And if it didn\u2019t the guilds inter-city system would provide me a way to still obtain obscure items for use within the skill just through other means.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, I have been thinking about this a lot a work. And honestly man\u2019s needs a break. I wasn\u2019t going to post because I\u2019m too old for this game and my thoughts are grimy but I love the game too much and I know how much ya\u2019ll work off creativity. I wish I could be more coherent or write a little more in-depth but that\u2019s just not my thing.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108llbj\/clothiery\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108llbj\/clothiery\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 04:29 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Theatre of Blood Entry Mode (Help needed)","content":"Hey guys :D  \n\n\nI only need 2 more quests for my quest cape and one of them is A night at the theatre.

I am making this due to the lack of assistance for people asking this question with everyone mentioning to \"Just look at the wiki\" which is true but also just seeing the drop rate disregards the defense level of the monsters or the ability to kill them quickly or secondary drops. IMPORTANT: if you are going to farm ancient shards you should always make sure that you combine your dark totem pieces so a new piece can drop. Skotizo will likely be one of the best sources of ancient shards.   \nStarting with low level ancient shard farming I would go to hill giants due to their low defensive stats and low hp level as well as the fact that there are 13 spawns for them. If your stats are lower you can also go to the skeletons with an even lower defense level and a drop rate close to hill giants, however, there is only 6 of them that spawn in the catacombs. Overall I wouldn't suggest farming ancient shards at a low level since you likely won't need them until you start killing Zammy gwd or demonic gorillas.\n\nGoing to mid level I personally would just do slayer tasks the catacombs since the \"bigger and badder\" slayer perk allows for the random higher level slayer monsters to spawn. These are important because they always drop a dark totem piece and have one of the best drop rates for ancient shards minus skotizo. \n\nAnother mid level alternative would be to kill brutal black dragons due to the fact that they are a good source of money and drop ancient shards at a decent rate. I will say that brutal black dragons are slower to kill so you will get less ancient shards per hour but you also profit.\n\nHigh level\/ magic training\/ really needing ancient shards: \n\nIf you are just really needing ancient shards for a boss that you currently have as a slayer task or you just really need ancient shards for some reason then the fastest possible way to get them would be to burst\/barrage. Inside the catacombs there are multiple monsters that you can burst to get good magic experience as well as ancient shards. \n\nThe one to burst with no requirements that I personally do not recommend would be dagannoth. You can burst dagannoth and get a decent amount of ancient shards at a 1\/286 1\/253 drop rate, however, they do not have good drops and you are likely to lose a lot of money doing this. Dagannoth do have the advantage of being aggressive which makes it less click intensive. \n\nAfter dagannoth the next one I would recommend with minimal level requirements would be bursting\/barraging dust devils. Dust devils have a very good drop table that can recover a lot of the cost of the runes and you will get ancient shards slightly slower than dagannoth. The downfall of dust devils is that you have to pull aggro on them and get them set up which makes it slower. This is why you will get more ancient shards per hour at dagannoth even though they have a lower drop rate. \n\nNechryael are the next best one with moderately high slayer requirements. These require 80 slayer but with their increased drop rate I find the ancient shards per hour to be virtually identical to bursting dagannoths and you can recover a lot of the cost of runes off the drops. \n\nFinally Abyssal demons are another alternative to nechryael and personally I find them to be slightly slower ancient shards per hour than Nechryaels but they are a good alternative if you need more ancient shards and the thought of seeing another nechryael makes you sick to your stomach. Abyssal demons also have the ability to drop whips which is another great bonus and helps pay for your runes. \n\nThese in my opinion are the best monsters to kill while farming ancient shards.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108v0vh\/best_way_to_farm_ancient_shards\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/108v0vh\/best_way_to_farm_ancient_shards\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-10 11:07 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-10"},{"title":"Jag, why you bully me?

I make an account, really enjoy it for a while and then abandon it. This is often at the 2000-2100 total mark. I was kind of curious how you guys are dealing with this. \n\nWhen OSRS released i had a bunch of goals. The thing that really motivated me was that these goals were reachable. I knew that i could do end-game PvM eventually. When GWD was released i also knew that if i grinded it, i could obtain the drops. Even if i went dry, it was all in reach. I really enjoyed OSRS. \n\nNow, almost 10 years later, i am just demotivated. I have 3 accounts. A main, an iron, a Hardcore iron. Each of these accounts is over 2k total with the highest being just over 2100. I sometimes AFK the iron while i work but that's about it. \n\nThe reason for this demotivation is that the game became centered around \"full-time players\". OSRS isn't a game anymore, it's a job. If you don't put in at least 60-80 hours a week you are never ever going to \"complete\" this game. I'm not even talking about maxing but about PvM. \n\nThey put in grinds like the Wyvern Sigil, Dragon Warhammer, Basilisk Jaw which were rare enough but still manageable i suppose. Then we got stuff like the Corp sigils, Nightmare, Raids. It just got so insanely rare to receive a drop in your name it demotivated me hard. As a reference a bowfa alone takes about 80-100 hours if you go on drop rate. That's an insane amount of time for just 1 item in a video game. \n\nI put in the work. My Iron even has some raids items, the Dragon Warhammer, Jaw and more. I just got so demotivated knowing i will never be able to get this account to where i want it to be. Everything just got way too rare. I don't have this amount of time. Even if i did, the drops are so rare it's just not fun anymore. Completing the Nightmare, Nex or any Raid is literal torture. \n\nAlso to add: I'm not saying items should not be rare. I just feel like we went from rare to absolutely mental and i have no idea why. \n\nDoes anyone else share this feeling? How do you deal with it?

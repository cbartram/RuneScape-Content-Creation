It involves buying items for a low price and selling them for a higher price to turn a profit.\n\nTo start flipping, you'll need some money to invest. You can earn money by completing quests, killing monsters, or participating in activities such as skilling or player-versus-player combat.\n\nHere are some tips to get you started with flipping in OSRS:\n\n1. Start small: Don't try to flip high-value items right away. Start with items that are easy to buy and sell, such as herbs or arrows.\n2. Use the Grand Exchange: The Grand Exchange is a marketplace where you can buy and sell items. It's a good place to find deals and to sell items quickly.\n3. Look for items with low supply and high demand: These are items that are in high demand but are not being produced or obtained very quickly. They will typically sell for a higher price than similar items with higher supply.\n4. Keep an eye on the market: Pay attention to price trends and fluctuations to find items that are undervalued or overvalued. You can use the Grand Exchange Market Watch to track prices.\n5. Be patient: Flipping can be a slow process, especially when you're starting out. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results.\n\nRemember, flipping is not a guaranteed way to make money in OSRS. It requires patience, skill, and a bit of luck. But if you're willing to put in the time and effort, it can be a lucrative way to earn money in the game.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103rr0n\/mastering_the_art_of_flipping_a_beginners_guide\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103rr0n\/mastering_the_art_of_flipping_a_beginners_guide\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-05 01:25 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-05"},{"title":"My girlfriend, who I live with broke up with me, and I live on the couch now, bit of scaping, bit of a sandwich","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103rsni\/my_girlfriend_who_i_live_with_broke_up_with_me\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/6v36gowwm7aa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-05 01:28 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-05"},{"title":"Would it be too much to ask for a \"drop inventory\" option on mobile?","content":"I guess this could also be for regular users of course.

This version would be untradable and have the same stats as a regular bowfa. But instead of corrupting it with shards to never need to recharge it again, this version would require 8x the crystal shard upkeep of a non corrupted bow to continue to use (8x is just a quick thought, my ides would aim for it to be balanced around the idea of 1 hour of CG = enough shards for 1 hour of bowfa use)\n\nSetting a certain amount of crystal shards to simply purchase an enhanced seed is something I've seen proposed as well (and personally would love), but poses the issue of flooding the market with a lot of bowfas and crashing the value.\n\nMaking a different version that's less desireable on a main would make that less of an issue.\n\nThe fact that crystal shards are untradeable would help avoid this version crashing the market. Yes, zalcano bots\/farmers would have plenty of shards to purchase these with, which is why it would need to be an untradeable version of the bow so it wouldn't devalue regular bowfas for mains. \n\nMains could also grind for 2k shards to get a budget bowfa, but most would find the upkeep to not be worth it and just purchase a regular version.\n\nAnother benefit is this would force irons to continue to grind passively for more shards to continue to use it, rather than needing to actively grind for it, and eventually should (hopefully) lead to getting the regular enhanced version over time. \n\nUsing an enhanced on an unstable version of the bow would \"fix\" it and turn it into a corrupted version (directly to the corrupted version since 2k shards were already used on it).\n\nTL;DR - Add an option after 400 CG KC to purchase an \"Unstable\" weapon seed for 2k shards to get an untradeable \"Unstable\" bowfa. It'd have the same stats as a normal bowfa, but would degrade at a much, much faster rate and isn't desirable or economy breaking for mains. Allows irons to use a bowfa sparingly if they go dry on the cg grind, but still incentivizes them to continue to grind passively.","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103qq4k\/bowfa_grind_solution_proposal\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/103qq4k\/bowfa_grind_solution_proposal\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-05 12:31 AM","created_at_date":"2023-01-05"},{"title":"Thoughts on slayer chests giving pets","content":"Hello r\/2007scape,\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Konar and Krystilia giving a pet?

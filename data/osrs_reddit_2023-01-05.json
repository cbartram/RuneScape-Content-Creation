Here goes;\n\nAttack: the whip was your most recent big upgrade and you\u2019ve never changed from it. You bounced from slayer task to boss task and back and before you noticed, you were at 90 attack and decided to just send it at nmz for the rest. The rest of your gear maximizes accuracy; if you have a dwh, you have a dwarven helm and tyrannical ring i as well. \n\nStrength: damage go up and your caveman brain LOVES that shit, especially when it\u2019s on other players. You have more than one account that has 99 in a combat stat and nowhere else. The max hit update made a part of your soul sparkle like nothing has before. You\u2019re probably alright outside of game but you feel strongly about PvP updates. \n\nDefense: you\u2019re a monster. You went to edgeville with an event rpg and didn\u2019t leave until you were a clinically certified sociopath. You miss the days where a rune Minotaur followed you around while you smacked people with dragon fire shield damage. You unironically enjoy CBT. \n\nRange: you can\u2019t be bothered to be in melee range. Praying and eating isn\u2019t afk enough. You\u2019ve spent more time in safe spots than you have with your significant other. Rigor was your first big purchase and bowfa was your second. You\u2019re pretty good at darts, in game and out. \n\nPrayer: you either go to church every Sunday or you got a really really good deal on dragon bones a while back. You\u2019ve been in workless\u2019 POH more than they have and you\u2019ve been at the wilderness altar to know all the regular pkers on a first name basis. You have a favorite in game god. \n\nMagic: you\u2019ve worn the 5 key off of your num pad once you realized you can use mouse keys to left click on your keyboard. Every bit of profit you made from high alching was spent on bursts, which you used at mm2 tunnels and then at every slayer task you could. Your health and magic levels were disproportionate for a while. You\u2019ve  played a wizard in every rpg. \n\nRunecrafting: I have no explanation for this. See a doctor. Many of us are probably on the spectrum but you may very well be in need of immediate in-depth medical assistance. I hope for the best for you and your family. \n\nConstruction: you had lots of money to spend and decided to spend it on the most useful skill (up to about level 83). After that, it was all for show. You may or may not have been involved in an incident resulting in the pvp deaths of players in a safe environment. 1116111112211611112111 gives you flashbacks to wrist pain and translucent home features. You might\u2019ve worked in some form of masonry, carpentry or plumbing in your life. \n\nHitpoints: you\u2019re a very all around player. You do a bit of everything and it shows. You like to keep your levels pretty even, going so far as to keep your melee stats within 5 of each other. You play lots of games and osrs is definitely one of them. You thought you\u2019d be more excited about your first skillcape. \n\nAgility: your gameplay is complimented by many finished Netflix series. You\u2019ve got every graceful recolor and are working on the black graceful but you don\u2019t like hallowed sepulchre that much. You\u2019re a major Nascar fan and you do a charity 5k run once a year. \n\nHerblore: you\u2019re a big fan of Breaking Bad. You were getting Herblore levels for Chambers but figured, hey fuck it let\u2019s get a 99 that\u2019s relaxing and useful. You low key are banking on the 6 dose flasks from rs2 coming to osrs one day. You\u2019ve made a mint off of crystal shards and divine potions and you might just break even one day maybe. Your potions tab is more well organized than a pharmacy and you opened a cocktail bar where all the drinks are named for potions. \n\nThieving: you\u2019re either a regular player or an ironman but either way you couldn\u2019t find a more satisfying way to make money in the game so here you are. Your pyramid plunder completion count is only rivaled by how many times you\u2019ve been reported for flaming people who leave the door open in Ardougne. You\u2019ve never stolen anything in real life but you might forget to scan a thing or two at the self serve section of the grocery. \n\nCrafting: this isn\u2019t your first account but this is your new main and you sought to do this one efficiently. The crafting cape never leaves your inventory and EHP never leaves your mind. You used to make bionicles and model airplanes but haven\u2019t in a while. \n\nFletching: you got tired of not having a 99 so decided to get one that wasn\u2019t as brainless as cooking or toxic as firemaking. You got this on mobile by tapping your screen in two spots for four hours out of your eight hour shifts at work. You wear the cape everywhere but have never used its special perk (no one has). You\u2019ve quit osrs many times and have restarted one more time than that. \n\nSlayer: you live for status. Your all black cape on your all black character is your most prized possession in and out of game. You\u2019ve wasted more hours recoiling slayer tasks than the defense guy spent playing dedicated to his goal. You have a maxed skiller account and you have an account with 9 hp on rs3. Nothing in your wardrobe is less than 120 dollars. \n\nHunter: you\u2019re probably an ironman who wanted 99 range as his first max skill but died with your last chin stack. Or you\u2019re one of them filthy snowflakes that got 99 for barehand lucky imps. Either way, I\u2019m looking forward to the next episode of your series. You\u2019ve never hunted in your life but you admire mounted deer heads and camo outfits. \n\nMining: you\u2019re here for the challenge. You\u2019ve got the same problem the runecrafting guy does but at least now you\u2019re on medicine and know that the goal you\u2019ve pursued is part of a bigger thing. You\u2019ve got a playlist of 100bpm songs and you can tick mine granite in your sleep. You have a wrist brace and a neck beard. \n\nSmithing: you like making money the old fashioned way. You paid your way through blast furnace college and have a cozy gig making rune 2 handers in bulk to sell to the Magic guy. You tried tig welding a basket on your bike as a teenager and when you melted the entire thing you picked up osrs while grounded. \n\nFishing: you like variety in one skill. You\u2019ve sit at the same karambwan spot for months. You\u2019ve made millions from the lava pools and swamp spots. You\u2019ve got hi score Tempoross kc and you can walk any noob through setting up two tick swordfishing or 2.5t barbarian fishing, whatever the fuck that means. You\u2019ve gone bass fishing a few times with Dad as a kid and while it was boring, you kinda miss it. \n\nCooking: you and fletching guy are buddies. Instead of clicking two spots all day, you like clicking one spot occasionally all day. You lived for the fat exp drop of making tons of wines at once (or you would if you could quit messing up). You got this cape and have not cooked once since. You like trying recipes irl but you never make the same thing more than a couple times. \n\nFiremaking: you\u2019re an ironman. You got this cape before you got 20 hp. You\u2019re still dry on tome but have two dragon axes because why not. You probably burn logs at the west brazier you sick bastard. You\u2019d be having more fun looking at the game around you but you\u2019re too busy looking at the next ten steps on the Oziris guide. \n\nWoodcutting: you\u2019re the most afk player there is. You got hooked on the nostalgia of cutting willows at draynor while listening to a personally crafted playlist of music from 2005 and before you knew if you were sitting at redwoods for 6 hours a day while only playing for one of them. You play almost exclusively on mobile and spend your time cutting magic logs and getting afk-logged while trying to sustain a 1.2 k\/d on Warzone. \n\nFarming: you\u2019re the most consistent but least dedicated of these players. You log on to do enough herb runs to pay for the tree runs and that\u2019s your day. Youd love to play more but between the wife and kids and work you don\u2019t have the time.

Been kinda discouraged as I had so much time and little to show for it and didn't feel like I was improving much.  All that time spent learning switches and overheads was well worth it as this was the most satisfying gp I've ever gotten. I never would have tried to attack this guy as I only had about 3 mil risk but he tbed me so I figured I would at least go down fighting. If you are trying to get into pking just ignore the lms shit talk and keep at it.  It is extremely satisfying when it comes together. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o8lxv3h9qcaa1.png?width=1470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fd68d8ce53412b06e51b815bf2ffbf2591f36df)","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/104kyou\/first_good_pk\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/104kyou\/first_good_pk\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-05 11:42 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-05"},{"title":"Got 50 slayer and 1750 total!!","content":"","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/104kz3h\/got_50_slayer_and_1750_total\/","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/9iomasc29eaa1.jpg","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-05 11:43 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-05"},{"title":"Let us fart on an air rune to let all spells deal poison damage","content":"Makes sense","subreddit":"2007scape","permalink":"\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/104l126\/let_us_fart_on_an_air_rune_to_let_all_spells_deal\/","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/2007scape\/comments\/104l126\/let_us_fart_on_an_air_rune_to_let_all_spells_deal\/","created_at_timestamp":"2023-01-05 11:46 PM","created_at_date":"2023-01-05"},{"title":"Loot from 1000 loot keys.
